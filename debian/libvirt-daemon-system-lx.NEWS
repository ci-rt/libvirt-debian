libvirt (2.5.0-2~) unstable; urgency=medium

  libvirt-daemon-system now uses the allocated uid and gid 64055
  for the libvirt-qemu user and group on new installations, when
  the uid/gid is available (otherwise a debconf warning is shown).

  On existing installations, which have different uid/gid values
  assigned, the recommended procedure is to reassign the uid/gid
  (might require considerations for ownership/permission changes).
  No debconf warning is shown in this case; only this NEWS entry.

  This change is in order to prevent I/O errors during migration
  of guests with disk image files shared over NFS, caused by the
  different uid/gid ownership between the source and destination
  host systems, which leads to access/permission errors with NFS.

  If guest migration over NFS is not a requirement in the system,
  there should not be any impact to the guests for not using the
  allocated uid/gid.

libvirt (1.2.9~rc1-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  libvirtd now uses PolicyKit instead of unix socket domain permissions for r/w
  connections. This has the advantage of requiring less reconfiguration when
  using ACL based access and bringing us closer to upstream's recommendations.
  In order to keep old configurations working we're still allowing all members
  of the libvirt group full access via /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/60-libvirt.rules.

  If you want to continue to use socket permission based access control you can
  still configure it in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf.
