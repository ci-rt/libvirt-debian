+LibVirt : simple API for virtualization - with r4d support
+==========================================================
+
+This is a customized version of libvirt. It supports the communication
+with r4d ('Remote For Device-under-test') via libvirt. Only the branch
+debian/jessie-backports is maintained! It is a clone of the debian/sid
+branch (debian version 2.4.0-1) and adapted for the needs of jessie.
+
+Prerequisite
+------------
+
+This is a description for a Debian jessie based system!
+
+First you need to build https://github.com/ci-rt/libr4d[libr4d] and
+install the development package.
+
+Cloning the git repository:
+----
+$ git clone https://github.com/ci-rt/libvirt-debian.git
+----
+
+Checking for unmet build dependencies (and install them):
+----
+$ cd libvirt-debian
+$ dpkg-checkbuilddeps
+----
+
+
+Build and install as Debian Packages
+------------------------------------
+
+Build binary packages only:
+----
+$ cd libvirt-debian
+$ dpkg-buildpackage -b
+----
+
+If you like to install libvirt-daemon and libvirt-daemon-system
+packages, you need to install the systemd-sysv package from the
+jessie-backports section of Debian.
+
+To install the built Debian packages use
+'sudo dpkg -i PATH_TO_PACKAGE'
+
+
+Default README content
+----------------------
+
+  Libvirt is a C toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities
+of recent versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software
+available under the GNU Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of
+the Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
+Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the basic
+resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aim at providing
+long term stable C API initially for the Xen paravirtualization but
+should be able to integrate other virtualization mechanisms if needed.

-Libvirt API for virtualization
-==============================
-
-Libvirt provides a portable, long term stable C API for managing the
-virtualization technologies provided by many operating systems. It
-includes support for QEMU, KVM, Xen, LXC, bhyve, Virtuozzo, VMware
-vCenter and ESX, VMware Desktop, Hyper-V, VirtualBox and the POWER
-Hypervisor.
-
-For some of these hypervisors, it provides a stateful management
-daemon which runs on the virtualization host allowing access to the
-API both by non-privileged local users and remote users.
-
-Layered packages provide bindings of the libvirt C API into other
-languages including Python, Perl, PHP, Go, Java, OCaml, as well as
-mappings into object systems such as GObject, CIM and SNMP.
-
-Further information about the libvirt project can be found on the
-website:
-
-[https://libvirt.org](https://libvirt.org)
-
-
-License
--------
-
-The libvirt C API is distributed under the terms of GNU Lesser General
-Public License, version 2.1 (or later). Some parts of the code that are
-not part of the C library may have the more restrictive GNU General
-Public License, version 2.1 (or later). See the files `COPYING.LESSER`
-and `COPYING` for full license terms & conditions.
-
-
-Installation
-------------
-
-Libvirt uses the GNU Autotools build system, so in general can be built
-and installed with the usual commands. For example, to build in a manner
-that is suitable for installing as root, use:
-
-```
-$ ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
-$ make
-$ sudo make install
-```
-
-While to build & install as an unprivileged user
-
-```
-$ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/usr
-$ make
-$ make install
-```
-
-The libvirt code relies on a large number of 3rd party libraries. These will
-be detected during execution of the `configure` script and a summary printed
-which lists any missing (optional) dependencies.
-
-
-Contributing
-------------
-
-The libvirt project welcomes contributions in many ways. For most components
-the best way to contribute is to send patches to the primary development
-mailing list. Further guidance on this can be found on the website:
-
-[https://libvirt.org/contribute.html](https://libvirt.org/contribute.html)
-
-
-Contact
--------
-
-The libvirt project has two primary mailing lists:
-
-  * libvirt-users@redhat.com (**for user discussions**)
-  * libvir-list@redhat.com (**for development only**)
-
-Further details on contacting the project are available on the website:
