libvirt (1.1.4-2) unstable; urgency=low

  If you're using cgroups make sure you're using a different mount per cgroup
  controller (cpu, memory, ...) that is mounted to /sys/fs/cgroup/<controller>.
  This can be achieved using mount_cgroups in /etc/default/libvirt-bin or by
  using systemd. Using a single mount point /sys/fs/cgroup for all controllers
  will no longer work and will prevent vms from starting. See

  http://libvirt.org/cgroups.html

  for more information. If you're not using cgroups nothing has to be changed.

libvirt (1.0.2-3) experimental; urgency=low

  For qemu:///system KVM/QEMU processes now run as group libvirt-qemu. This
  makes sure image files and volumes aren't accessible by users in the more
  general and previously used kvm group. To change this behaviour adjust the
  group option in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf.

libvirt (0.8.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Disk format probing is disabled now by default for security reasons
  (CVE-2010-2237). You need to explicitly add a driver type element to your
  disk devices in the domain XML:

      <disk ...>
         <driver name='qemu' type='qcow2'/>
         ...
      </disk>

  Alternatively you can re-enable probing by setting
  allow_disk_format_probing=1 in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf but this is insecure.

libvirt (0.8.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  If you're using a script such as /etc/qemu-ifup to set up QEMU network
  interfaces, have a look at README.Debian about the new config option
  clear_emulator_capabilities in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf.
  When using NAT via libvirt's default network you don't have to change
  anything.
