.PP
\&\fBvirsh\fR [\fI\s-1OPTION\s0\fR]... \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR [\fI\s-1ARG\s0\fR]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBvirsh\fR program is the main interface for managing virsh guest
domains. The program can be used to create, pause, and shutdown
domains. It can also be used to list current domains. Libvirt is a C
toolkit to interact with the virtualization capabilities of recent
versions of Linux (and other OSes). It is free software available
under the \s-1GNU\s0 Lesser General Public License. Virtualization of the
Linux Operating System means the ability to run multiple instances of
Operating Systems concurrently on a single hardware system where the
basic resources are driven by a Linux instance. The library aims at
providing a long term stable C \s-1API\s0.  It currently supports Xen, QEmu,
\&\s-1KVM\s0, \s-1LXC\s0, OpenVZ, VirtualBox and VMware \s-1ESX\s0.
.PP
The basic structure of most virsh usage is:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  virsh [OPTION]... <command> <domain\-id> [ARG]...
.Ve
.PP
Where \fIcommand\fR is one of the commands listed below, \fIdomain-id\fR
is the numeric domain id, or the domain name (which will be internally
translated to domain id), and \fI\s-1ARGS\s0\fR are command specific
options.  There are a few exceptions to this rule in the cases where
the command in question acts on all domains, the entire machine,
or directly on the xen hypervisor.  Those exceptions will be clear for
each of those commands.
.PP
The \fBvirsh\fR program can be used either to run one \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR by giving the
command and its arguments on the shell command line, or a \fI\s-1COMMAND_STRING\s0\fR
which is a single shell argument consisting of multiple \fI\s-1COMMAND\s0\fR actions
and their arguments joined with whitespace, and separated by semicolons
between commands.  Within \fI\s-1COMMAND_STRING\s0\fR, virsh understands the
same single, double, and backslash escapes as the shell, although you must
add another layer of shell escaping in creating the single shell argument.
If no command is given in the command line, \fBvirsh\fR will then start a minimal
interpreter waiting for your commands, and the \fBquit\fR command will then exit
the program.
.PP
The \fBvirsh\fR program understands the following \fI\s-1OPTIONS\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h, --help"
Ignore all other arguments, and behave as if the \fBhelp\fR command were
given instead.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-version[=short]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v, --version[=short]"
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virsh is coming from
.IP "\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version=long\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V, --version=long"
Ignore all other arguments, and prints the version of the libvirt library
virsh is coming from and which options and driver are compiled in.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-connect\fR \fI\s-1URI\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c, --connect URI"
Connect to the specified \fI\s-1URI\s0\fR, as if by the \fBconnect\fR command,
instead of the default connection.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR, \fB\-\-debug\fR \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d, --debug LEVEL"
Enable debug messages at integer \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR and above.  \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR can
range from 0 to 4 (default).  See the documentation of \fB\s-1VIRSH_DEBUG\s0\fR
environment variable below for the description of each \fI\s-1LEVEL\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-log\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-l, --log FILE"
Output logging details to \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q, --quiet"
Avoid extra informational messages.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR, \fB\-\-readonly\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r, --readonly"
Make the initial connection read-only, as if by the \fI\-\-readonly\fR
option of the \fBconnect\fR command.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-timing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t, --timing"
Output elapsed time information for each command.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-escape\fR \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e, --escape string"
Set alternative escape sequence for \fIconsole\fR command. By default,
telnet's \fB^]\fR is used.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
Most \fBvirsh\fR operations rely upon the libvirt library being able to
connect to an already running libvirtd service.  This can usually be
done using the command \fBservice libvirtd start\fR.
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands require root privileges to run due to the
communications channels used to talk to the hypervisor.  Running as
non root will return an error.
.PP
Most \fBvirsh\fR commands act synchronously, except maybe shutdown,
setvcpus and setmem. In those cases the fact that the \fBvirsh\fR
program returned, may not mean the action is complete and you
must poll periodically to detect that the guest completed the
operation.
.PP
\&\fBvirsh\fR strives for backward compatibility.  Although the \fBhelp\fR
command only lists the preferred usage of a command, if an older
version of \fBvirsh\fR supported an alternate spelling of a command or
option (such as \fI\-\-tunnelled\fR instead of \fI\-\-tunneled\fR), then
scripts using that older spelling will continue to work.
.PP
Several \fBvirsh\fR commands take an optionally scaled integer; if no
scale is provided, then the default is listed in the command (for
historical reasons, some commands default to bytes, while other
commands default to kibibytes).  The following case-insensitive
suffixes can be used to select a specfic scale:
  b, byte  byte      1
  \s-1KB\s0       kilobyte  1,000
  k, KiB   kibibyte  1,024
  \s-1MB\s0       megabyte  1,000,000
  M, MiB   mebibyte  1,048,576
  \s-1GB\s0       gigabyte  1,000,000,000
  G, GiB   gibibyte  1,073,741,824
  \s-1TB\s0       terabyte  1,000,000,000,000
  T, TiB   tebibyte  1,099,511,627,776
  \s-1PB\s0       petabyte  1,000,000,000,000,000
  P, PiB   pebibyte  1,125,899,906,842,624

.SH "GENERIC COMMANDS"
.IX Header "GENERIC COMMANDS"
The following commands are generic i.e. not specific to a domain.
.IP "\fBhelp\fR [\fIcommand-or-group\fR]" 4
.IX Item "help [command-or-group]"
This lists each of the virsh commands.  When used without options, all
commands are listed, one per line, grouped into related categories,
displaying the keyword for each group.
.Sp
To display only commands for a specific group, give the keyword for that
group as an option.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& virsh # help host
\&
\&  Host and Hypervisor (help keyword \*(Aqhost\*(Aq):
\&     capabilities                   capabilities

\&     uri                            print the hypervisor canonical URI
.Ve
.Sp
To display detailed information for a specific command, give its name as the
option instead.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3

.IP "\fBnodeinfo\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodeinfo"
Returns basic information about the node, like number and type of \s-1CPU\s0,
and size of the physical memory. The output corresponds to virNodeInfo
structure. Specifically, the \*(L"\s-1CPU\s0 socket(s)\*(R" field means number of \s-1CPU\s0
sockets per \s-1NUMA\s0 cell.
.IP "\fBnodecpustats\fR [\fIcpu\fR] [\fI\-\-percent\fR]" 4
.IX Item "nodecpustats [cpu] [--percent]"
Returns cpu stats of the node.
If \fIcpu\fR is specified, this will prints specified cpu statistics only.
If \fI\-\-percent\fR is specified, this will prints percentage of each kind of cpu
statistics during 1 second.
.IP "\fBnodememstats\fR [\fIcell\fR]" 4
.IX Item "nodememstats [cell]"
Returns memory stats of the node.
If \fIcell\fR is specified, this will prints specified cell statistics only.
.IP "\fBnodesuspend\fR [\fItarget\fR] [\fIduration\fR] [\fIflags\fR]" 4
.IX Item "nodesuspend [target] [duration] [flags]"
Puts the node (host machine) into a system-wide sleep state such as
Suspend-to-RAM, Suspend-to-Disk or Hybrid-Suspend and sets up a
Real-Time-Clock interrupt to fire (to wake up the node) after a time delay
specified by the 'duration' parameter.
.IP "\fBcapabilities\fR" 4
.IX Item "capabilities"
Print an \s-1XML\s0 document describing the capabilities of the hypervisor
we are currently connected to. This includes a section on the host
capabilities in terms of \s-1CPU\s0 and features, and a set of description
for each kind of guest which can be virtualized. For a more complete
description see:

.IX Item "list [--inactive | --all] [--managed-save] [--title] { [--table] | --name | --uuid } [--persistent] [--transient]"
Prints information about existing domains.  If no options are
specified it prints out information about running domains.
.Sp
An example format for the list is as follows:
.Sp
\&\fBvirsh\fR list
 Id Name                 State
.Sp

.Sp
.Vb 2

\&  2 fedora               paused
.Ve
.Sp
Name is the name of the domain.  \s-1ID\s0 the domain numeric id.
State is the run state (see below).
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1STATES\s0\fR
.Sp
The State field lists 8 states for a domain, and which ones the
current domain is in.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBrunning\fR" 4
.IX Item "running"
The domain is currently running on a \s-1CPU\s0
.IP "\fBidle\fR" 4
.IX Item "idle"
The domain is idle, and not running or runnable.  This can be caused
because the domain is waiting on \s-1IO\s0 (a traditional wait state) or has
gone to sleep because there was nothing else for it to do.
.IP "\fBpaused\fR" 4
.IX Item "paused"
The domain has been paused, usually occurring through the administrator
running \fBvirsh suspend\fR.  When in a paused state the domain will still
consume allocated resources like memory, but will not be eligible for
scheduling by the hypervisor.
.IP "\fBshutdown\fR" 4
.IX Item "shutdown"
The domain is in the process of shutting down, i.e. the guest operating system
has been notified and should be in the process of stopping its operations
gracefully.
.IP "\fBshut off\fR" 4
.IX Item "shut off"
The domain is not running.  Usually this indicates the domain has been
shut down completely, or has not been started.
.IP "\fBcrashed\fR" 4
.IX Item "crashed"
The domain has crashed, which is always a violent ending.  Usually
this state can only occur if the domain has been configured not to
restart on crash.
.IP "\fBdying\fR" 4
.IX Item "dying"
The domain is in process of dying, but hasn't completely shutdown or
crashed.
.IP "\fBpmsuspended\fR" 4
.IX Item "pmsuspended"
The domain has been suspended by guest power management, e.g. entered
into s3 state.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fI\-\-managed\-save\fR is specified, then domains that have managed save
state (only possible if they are in the \fBshut off\fR state) will
instead show as \fBsaved\fR in the listing. This flag is usable only with the
default \fI\-\-table\fR output.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-name\fR is specified, domain names are printed instead of the table
formatted one per line. If \fI\-\-uuid\fR is specified domain's \s-1UUID\s0's are printed
instead of names. Flag \fI\-\-table\fR specifies that the legacy table-formatted
output should be used. This is the default. All of these are mutually
exclusive.
.Sp
Flag \fI\-\-persistent\fR specifies that persistent domains should be printed.
Similarly \fI\-\-transient\fR enables output of transient domains. These flags
may be combined. Default behavior is as though both were specified. (Note that
if any of these flags is specified, the check for the persistence state is done
and may fail. If none of these flags is specified, the check is skipped.)
.Sp
If \fI\-\-title\fR is specified, then the domain note is printed. The output then
the output looks as follows. This flag is usable only with the default
\&\fI\-\-table\fR output.
.Sp

.IP "\fBfreecell\fR [{ [\fI\-\-cellno\fR] \fBcellno\fR | \fI\-\-all\fR }]" 4
.IX Item "freecell [{ [--cellno] cellno | --all }]"
Prints the available amount of memory on the machine or within a \s-1NUMA\s0
cell.  The freecell command can provide one of three different
displays of available memory on the machine depending on the options
specified.  With no options, it displays the total free memory on the
machine.  With the \-\-all option, it displays the free memory in each
cell and the total free memory on the machine.  Finally, with a
numeric argument or with \-\-cellno plus a cell number it will display
the free memory for the specified cell only.
.IP "\fBcpu-baseline\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "cpu-baseline FILE"
Compute baseline \s-1CPU\s0 which will be supported by all host CPUs given in <file>.
The list of host CPUs is built by extracting all <cpu> elements from the
<file>. Thus, the <file> can contain either a set of <cpu> elements separated
by new lines or even a set of complete <capabilities> elements printed by
\&\fBcapabilities\fR command.

.IX Item "destroy domain-id [--graceful]"
Immediately terminate the domain domain-id.  This doesn't give the domain

cord out on a physical machine.  In most cases you will want to use
the \fBshutdown\fR command instead.  However, this does not delete any
storage volumes used by the guest, and if the domain is persistent, it
can be restarted later.

unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem,

destroyed when virsh closes its connection to libvirt, or otherwise
exits.  If \fI\-\-bypass\-cache\fR is specified, and managedsave state exists,
the restore will avoid the file system cache, although this may slow
down the operation.  If \fI\-\-force\-boot\fR is specified, then any
managedsave state is discarded and a fresh boot occurs.

.IX Item "undefine domain-id [--managed-save] [--snapshots-metadata] [ {--storage volumes | --remove-all-storage} --wipe-storage]"
Undefine a domain. If the domain is running, this converts it to a
transient domain, without stopping it. If the domain is inactive,
the domain configuration is removed.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-managed\-save\fR flag guarantees that any managed save image (see
the \fBmanagedsave\fR command) is also cleaned up.  Without the flag, attempts
to undefine a domain with a managed save image will fail.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-snapshots\-metadata\fR flag guarantees that any snapshots (see the
\&\fBsnapshot-list\fR command) are also cleaned up when undefining an inactive
domain.  Without the flag, attempts to undefine an inactive domain with
snapshot metadata will fail.  If the domain is active, this flag is
ignored.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-storage\fR flag takes a parameter \fBvolumes\fR, which is a comma separated
list of volume target names or source paths of storage volumes to be removed
along with the undefined domain. Volumes can be undefined and thus removed only
on inactive domains. Volume deletion is only attempted after the domain is
undefined; if not all of the requested volumes could be deleted, the
error message indicates what still remains behind. If a volume path is not
found in the domain definition, it's treated as if the volume was successfully
deleted.
(See \fBdomblklist\fR for list of target names associated to a domain).
Example: \-\-storage vda,/path/to/storage.img
.Sp
The \fI\-\-remove\-all\-storage\fR flag specifies that all of the domain's storage
volumes should be deleted.
.Sp
The flag \fI\-\-wipe\-storage\fR specifies that the storage volumes should be
wiped before removal.

.IX Item "vcpucount domain-id  [{--maximum | --active} {--config | --live | --current}]"
Print information about the virtual cpu counts of the given
\&\fIdomain-id\fR.  If no flags are specified, all possible counts are
listed in a table; otherwise, the output is limited to just the
numeric value requested.  For historical reasons, the table
lists the label \*(L"current\*(R" on the rows that can be queried in isolation
via the \fI\-\-active\fR flag, rather than relating to the \fI\-\-current\fR flag.
.Sp
\&\fI\-\-maximum\fR requests information on the maximum cap of vcpus that a
domain can add via \fBsetvcpus\fR, while \fI\-\-active\fR shows the current
usage; these two flags cannot both be specified.  \fI\-\-config\fR
requires a persistent domain and requests information regarding the next
time the domain will be booted, \fI\-\-live\fR requires a running domain and
lists current values, and \fI\-\-current\fR queries according to the current
state of the domain (corresponding to \fI\-\-live\fR if running, or
\&\fI\-\-config\fR if inactive); these three flags are mutually exclusive.
Thus, this command always takes exactly zero or two flags.
.IP "\fBvcpuinfo\fR \fIdomain-id\fR" 4

.IX Item "vcpupin domain-id [vcpu] [cpulist] [[--live] [--config] | [--current]]"
Query or change the pinning of domain VCPUs to host physical CPUs.  To
pin a single \fIvcpu\fR, specify \fIcpulist\fR; otherwise, you can query one
\&\fIvcpu\fR or omit \fIvcpu\fR to list all at once.
.Sp
\&\fIcpulist\fR is a list of physical \s-1CPU\s0 numbers. Its syntax is a comma
separated list and a special markup using '\-' and '^' (ex. '0\-4', '0\-3,^2') can
also be allowed. The '\-' denotes the range and the '^' denotes exclusive.
If you want to reset vcpupin setting, that is, to pin vcpu all physical cpus,
simply specify 'r' as a cpulist.
If \fI\-\-live\fR is specified, affect a running guest.
If \fI\-\-config\fR is specified, affect the next boot of a persistent guest.
If \fI\-\-current\fR is specified, affect the current guest state.
Both \fI\-\-live\fR and \fI\-\-config\fR flags may be given if \fIcpulist\fR is present,
but \fI\-\-current\fR is exclusive.
If no flag is specified, behavior is different depending on hypervisor.

.SH "NODEDEV COMMANDS"
.IX Header "NODEDEV COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate host devices that are intended to be
passed through to guest domains via <hostdev> elements in a domain's
<devices> section.  A node device key is generally specified by the bus
name followed by its address, using underscores between all components,
such as pci_0000_00_02_1, usb_1_5_3, or net_eth1_00_27_13_6a_fe_00.
The \fBnodedev-list\fR gives the full list of host devices that are known
to libvirt, although this includes devices that cannot be assigned to
a guest (for example, attempting to detach the \s-1PCI\s0 device that controls
the host's hard disk controller where the guest's disk images live could
cause the host system to lock up or reboot).
.PP
For more information on node device definition see:
<http://libvirt.org/formatnode.html>.
.PP
Passthrough devices cannot be simultaneously used by the host and its
guest domains, nor by multiple active guests at once.  If the
<hostdev> description includes the attribute \fBmanaged='yes'\fR, and the
hypervisor driver supports it, then the device is in managed mode, and
attempts to use that passthrough device in an active guest will
automatically behave as if \fBnodedev-detach\fR (guest start, device
hot-plug) and \fBnodedev-reattach\fR (guest stop, device hot-unplug) were
called at the right points (currently, qemu does this for \s-1PCI\s0 devices,
but not \s-1USB\s0).  If a device is not marked as managed, then it must
manually be detached before guests can use it, and manually reattached
to be returned to the host.  Also, if a device is manually detached,
then the host does not regain control of the device without a matching
reattach, even if the guests use the device in managed mode.
.IP "\fBnodedev-create\fR \fI\s-1FILE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-create FILE"
Create a device on the host node that can then be assigned to virtual
machines. Normally, libvirt is able to automatically determine which
host nodes are available for use, but this allows registration of
host hardware that libvirt did not automatically detect.  \fIfile\fR
contains xml for a top-level <device> description of a node device.
.IP "\fBnodedev-destroy\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-destroy nodedev"
Destroy (stop) a device on the host.  Note that this makes libvirt
quit managing a host device, and may even make that device unusable
by the rest of the physical host until a reboot.
.IP "\fBnodedev-detach\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-detach nodedev"
Detach \fInodedev\fR from the host, so that it can safely be used by
guests via <hostdev> passthrough.  This is reversed with
\&\fBnodedev-reattach\fR, and is done automatically for managed devices.
For compatibility purposes, this command can also be spelled
\&\fBnodedev-dettach\fR.

.IX Item "nodedev-dumpxml nodedev"
Dump a <device> \s-1XML\s0 representation for the given node device, including

.IX Item "nodedev-list cap --tree"
List all of the devices available on the node that are known by libvirt.

include the given capability.  If \fI\-\-tree\fR is used, the output is
formatted in a tree representing parents of each node.
.IP "\fBnodedev-reattach\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-reattach nodedev"
Declare that \fInodedev\fR is no longer in use by any guests, and that
the host can resume normal use of the device.  This is done
automatically for devices in managed mode, but must be done explicitly
to match any explicit \fBnodedev-detach\fR.
.IP "\fBnodedev-reset\fR \fInodedev\fR" 4
.IX Item "nodedev-reset nodedev"
Trigger a device reset for \fInodedev\fR, useful prior to transferring
a node device between guest passthrough or the host.  Libvirt will
often do this action implicitly when required, but this command
allows an explicit reset when needed.
.SH "VIRTUAL NETWORK COMMANDS"

.SH "INTERFACE COMMANDS"
.IX Header "INTERFACE COMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate host interfaces.  Often, these host
interfaces can then be used by name within domain <interface> elements
(such as a system-created bridge interface), but there is no
requirement that host interfaces be tied to any particular guest
configuration \s-1XML\s0 at all.
.PP
Many of the commands for host interfaces are similar to the ones used
for domains, and the way to name an interface is either by its name or
its \s-1MAC\s0 address.  However, using a \s-1MAC\s0 address for an \fIiface\fR
argument only works when that address is unique (if an interface and a
bridge share the same \s-1MAC\s0 address, which is often the case, then using
that \s-1MAC\s0 address results in an error due to ambiguity, and you must
resort to a name instead).
.IP "\fBiface-bridge\fR \fIinterface\fR \fIbridge\fR [\fI\-\-no\-stp\fR] [\fIdelay\fR] [\fI\-\-no\-start\fR]" 4
.IX Item "iface-bridge interface bridge [--no-stp] [delay] [--no-start]"
Create a bridge device named \fIbridge\fR, and attach the existing
network device \fIinterface\fR to the new bridge.  The new bridge
defaults to starting immediately, with \s-1STP\s0 enabled and a delay of 0;
these settings can be altered with \fI\-\-no\-stp\fR, \fI\-\-no\-start\fR, and an
integer number of seconds for \fIdelay\fR. All \s-1IP\s0 address configuration

.SH "SNAPSHOT COMMMANDS"
.IX Header "SNAPSHOT COMMMANDS"
The following commands manipulate domain snapshots.  Snapshots take the
disk, memory, and device state of a domain at a point-of-time, and save it
for future use.  They have many uses, from saving a \*(L"clean\*(R" copy of an \s-1OS\s0
image to saving a domain's state before a potentially destructive operation.
Snapshots are identified with a unique name.  See
<http://libvirt.org/formatsnapshot.html> for documentation of the \s-1XML\s0 format
used to represent properties of snapshots.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-create\fR \fIdomain\fR [\fIxmlfile\fR] {[\fI\-\-redefine\fR [\fI\-\-current\fR]] | [\fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR] [\fI\-\-halt\fR] [\fI\-\-disk\-only\fR] [\fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR] [\fI\-\-quiesce\fR] [\fI\-\-atomic\fR]}" 4
.IX Item "snapshot-create domain [xmlfile] {[--redefine [--current]] | [--no-metadata] [--halt] [--disk-only] [--reuse-external] [--quiesce] [--atomic]}"
Create a snapshot for domain \fIdomain\fR with the properties specified in
\&\fIxmlfile\fR.  Normally, the only properties settable for a domain snapshot
are the <name> and <description> elements, as well as <disks> if
\&\fI\-\-disk\-only\fR is given; the rest of the fields are
ignored, and automatically filled in by libvirt.  If \fIxmlfile\fR is
completely omitted, then libvirt will choose a value for all fields.
The new snapshot will become current, as listed by \fBsnapshot-current\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-halt\fR is specified, the domain will be left in an inactive state
after the snapshot is created.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR is specified, the snapshot will only include disk
state rather than the usual system checkpoint with vm state.  Disk
snapshots are faster than full system checkpoints, but reverting to a
disk snapshot may require fsck or journal replays, since it is like
the disk state at the point when the power cord is abruptly pulled;
and mixing \fI\-\-halt\fR and \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR loses any data that was not
flushed to disk at the time.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-redefine\fR is specified, then all \s-1XML\s0 elements produced by
\&\fBsnapshot-dumpxml\fR are valid; this can be used to migrate snapshot
hierarchy from one machine to another, to recreate hierarchy for the
case of a transient domain that goes away and is later recreated with
the same name and \s-1UUID\s0, or to make slight alterations in the snapshot
metadata (such as host-specific aspects of the domain \s-1XML\s0 embedded in
the snapshot).  When this flag is supplied, the \fIxmlfile\fR argument
is mandatory, and the domain's current snapshot will not be altered
unless the \fI\-\-current\fR flag is also given.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fI\-\-redefine\fR is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).
.Sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR is specified, and the snapshot \s-1XML\s0 requests an
external snapshot with a destination of an existing file, then the
destination must exist, and is reused; otherwise, a snapshot is refused
to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fR is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain's mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR to be passed as well.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fR is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fR must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.
.Sp
Existence of snapshot metadata will prevent attempts to \fBundefine\fR
a persistent domain.  However, for transient domains, snapshot
metadata is silently lost when the domain quits running (whether
by command such as \fBdestroy\fR or by internal guest action).
.IP "\fBsnapshot-create-as\fR \fIdomain\fR {[\fI\-\-print\-xml\fR] | [\fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR] [\fI\-\-halt\fR] [\fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR]} [\fIname\fR] [\fIdescription\fR] [\fI\-\-disk\-only\fR [\fI\-\-quiesce\fR] [\fI\-\-atomic\fR] [[\fI\-\-diskspec\fR] \fBdiskspec\fR]...]" 4

Create a snapshot for domain \fIdomain\fR with the given <name> and
<description>; if either value is omitted, libvirt will choose a
value.  If \fI\-\-print\-xml\fR is specified, then \s-1XML\s0 appropriate for
\&\fIsnapshot-create\fR is output, rather than actually creating a snapshot.
Otherwise, if \fI\-\-halt\fR is specified, the domain will be left in an
inactive state after the snapshot is created, and if \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR
is specified, the snapshot will not include vm state.
.Sp
The \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR flag is used to request a disk-only snapshot.  When
this flag is in use, the command can also take additional \fIdiskspec\fR
arguments to add <disk> elements to the xml.  Each <diskspec> is in the
form \fBdisk[,snapshot=type][,driver=type][,file=name]\fR.  To include a
literal comma in \fBdisk\fR or in \fBfile=name\fR, escape it with a second
comma.  A literal \fI\-\-diskspec\fR must preceed each \fBdiskspec\fR unless
all three of \fIdomain\fR, \fIname\fR, and \fIdescription\fR are also present.
For example, a diskspec of \*(L"vda,snapshot=external,file=/path/to,,new\*(R"
results in the following \s-1XML:\s0
  <disk name='vda' snapshot='external'>
    <source file='/path/to,new'/>
  </disk>
.Sp
If \fI\-\-reuse\-external\fR is specified, and the domain \s-1XML\s0 or \fIdiskspec\fR
option requests an external snapshot with a destination of an existing
file, then the destination must exist, and is reused; otherwise, a
snapshot is refused to avoid losing contents of the existing files.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-quiesce\fR is specified, libvirt will try to use guest agent
to freeze and unfreeze domain's mounted file systems. However,
if domain has no guest agent, snapshot creation will fail.
Currently, this requires \fI\-\-disk\-only\fR to be passed as well.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-no\-metadata\fR is specified, then the snapshot data is created,
but any metadata is immediately discarded (that is, libvirt does not
treat the snapshot as current, and cannot revert to the snapshot
unless \fBsnapshot-create\fR is later used to teach libvirt about the
metadata again).  This flag is incompatible with \fI\-\-print\-xml\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-atomic\fR is specified, libvirt will guarantee that the snapshot
either succeeds, or fails with no changes; not all hypervisors support
this.  If this flag is not specified, then some hypervisors may fail
after partially performing the action, and \fBdumpxml\fR must be used to
see whether any partial changes occurred.

Without \fIsnapshotname\fR, this will output the snapshot \s-1XML\s0 for the domain's
current snapshot (if any).  If \fI\-\-name\fR is specified, just the
current snapshot name instead of the full xml.  Otherwise, using
\&\fI\-\-security\-info\fR will also include security sensitive information in
the \s-1XML\s0.
.Sp
With \fIsnapshotname\fR, this is a request to make the existing named
snapshot become the current snapshot, without reverting the domain.

Edit the \s-1XML\s0 configuration file for \fIsnapshotname\fR of a domain.  If
both \fIsnapshotname\fR and \fI\-\-current\fR are specified, also force the
edited snapshot to become the current snapshot.  If \fIsnapshotname\fR
is omitted, then \fI\-\-current\fR must be supplied, to edit the current
snapshot.

variables, and defaults to \f(CW\*(C`vi\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-rename\fR is specified, then the edits can change the snapshot
name.  If \fI\-\-clone\fR is specified, then changing the snapshot name
will create a clone of the snapshot metadata.  If neither is specified,
then the edits must not change the snapshot name.  Note that changing
a snapshot name must be done with care, since the contents of some
snapshots, such as internal snapshots within a single qcow2 file, are
accessible only from the original name.

.Sp
If \fI\-\-parent\fR is specified, add a column to the output table giving
the name of the parent of each snapshot.  If \fI\-\-roots\fR is specified,
the list will be filtered to just snapshots that have no parents.
If \fI\-\-tree\fR is specified, the output will be in a tree format, listing
just snapshot names.  These three options are mutually exclusive.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-from\fR is provided, filter the list to snapshots which are
children of the given \fBsnapshot\fR; or if \fI\-\-current\fR is provided,
start at the current snapshot.  When used in isolation or with
\&\fI\-\-parent\fR, the list is limited to direct children unless
\&\fI\-\-descendants\fR is also present.  When used with \fI\-\-tree\fR, the
use of \fI\-\-descendants\fR is implied.  This option is not compatible
with \fI\-\-roots\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-leaves\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to just
snapshots that have no children.  This option is not compatible
with \fI\-\-tree\fR.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-metadata\fR is specified, the list will be filtered to just
snapshots that involve libvirt metadata, and thus would prevent
\&\fBundefine\fR of a persistent domain, or be lost on \fBdestroy\fR of
a transient domain.

.IX Item "snapshot-revert domain {snapshot | --current} [{--running | --paused}] [--force]"
Revert the given domain to the snapshot specified by \fIsnapshot\fR, or to
the current snapshot with \fI\-\-current\fR.  Be aware
that this is a destructive action; any changes in the domain since the last
snapshot was taken will be lost.  Also note that the state of the domain after
snapshot-revert is complete will be the state of the domain at the time
the original snapshot was taken.
.Sp
Normally, reverting to a snapshot leaves the domain in the state it was
at the time the snapshot was created, except that a disk snapshot with
no vm state leaves the domain in an inactive state.  Passing either the
\&\fI\-\-running\fR or \fI\-\-paused\fR flag will perform additional state changes
(such as booting an inactive domain, or pausing a running domain).  Since
transient domains cannot be inactive, it is required to use one of these
flags when reverting to a disk snapshot of a transient domain.
.Sp
There are two cases where a snapshot revert involves extra risk, which
requires the use of \fI\-\-force\fR to proceed.  One is the case of a
snapshot that lacks full domain information for reverting
configuration (such as snapshots created prior to libvirt 0.9.5);
since libvirt cannot prove that the current configuration matches what
was in use at the time of the snapshot, supplying \fI\-\-force\fR assures
libvirt that the snapshot is compatible with the current configuration
(and if it is not, the domain will likely fail to run).  The other is
the case of reverting from a running domain to an active state where a
new hypervisor has to be created rather than reusing the existing
hypervisor, because it implies drawbacks such as breaking any existing
\&\s-1VNC\s0 or Spice connections; this condition happens with an active
snapshot that uses a provably incompatible configuration, as well as
with an inactive snapshot that is combined with the \fI\-\-start\fR or
\&\fI\-\-pause\fR flag.
.IP "\fBsnapshot-delete\fR \fIdomain\fR {\fIsnapshot\fR | \fI\-\-current\fR} [\fI\-\-metadata\fR] [{\fI\-\-children\fR | \fI\-\-children\-only\fR}]" 4
.IX Item "snapshot-delete domain {snapshot | --current} [--metadata] [{--children | --children-only}]"
Delete the snapshot for the domain named \fIsnapshot\fR, or the current
snapshot with \fI\-\-current\fR.  If this snapshot
has child snapshots, changes from this snapshot will be merged into the
children.  If \fI\-\-children\fR is passed, then delete this snapshot and any
children of this snapshot.  If \fI\-\-children\-only\fR is passed, then delete
any children of this snapshot, but leave this snapshot intact.  These
two flags are mutually exclusive.
.Sp
If \fI\-\-metadata\fR is specified, then only delete the snapshot metadata
maintained by libvirt, while leaving the snapshot contents intact for
access by external tools; otherwise deleting a snapshot also removes
the data contents from that point in time.
.SH "NWFILTER COMMMANDS"

Individual network traffic filters are written in \s-1XML\s0 and may contain
