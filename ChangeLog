	qemu: Start nested job in qemuDomainCheckEjectableMedia
	Originally, qemuDomainCheckEjectableMedia was entering monitor with qemu
	driver lock. Commit 2067e31bf97667eab9f111b496f5e9a44e827c5b, which I
	made to fix that, revealed another issue we had (but didn't notice it
	since the driver was locked): we didn't set nested job when
	qemuDomainCheckEjectableMedia is called during migration. Thus the
	original fix I made was wrong.

	Xen: Fix <clock> handling
	XenD-3.1 introduced managed domains. HV-domains have rtc_timeoffset
	(hgd24f37b31030 from 2007-04-03), which tracks the offset between the
	hypervisors clock and the domains RTC, and is persisted by XenD.
	In combination with localtime=1 this had a bug until XenD-3.4
	(hg5d701be7c37b from 2009-04-01) (I'm not 100% sure how that bug
	manifests, but at least for me in TZ=Europe/Berlin I see the previous
	offset relative to utc being applied to localtime again, which manifests
	in an extra hour being added)

	XenD implements the following variants for clock/@offset:
	- PV domains don't have a RTC → 'localtime' | 'utc'
	- <3.1: no managed domains → 'localtime' | 'utc'
	- ≥3.1: the offset is tracked for HV → 'variable'
	        due to the localtime=1 bug → 'localtime' | 'utc'
	- ≥3.4: the offset is tracked for HV → 'variable'

	Current libvirtd still thinks XenD only implements <clock offset='utc'/>
	and <clock offset='localtime'/>, which is wrong, since the semantic of
	'utc' and 'localtime' specifies, that the offset will be reset on
	domain-restart, while with 'variable' the offset is kept. (keeping the
	offset over "virsh edit" is important, since otherwise the clock might
	jump, which confuses certain guest OSs)

	xendConfigVersion was last incremented to 4 by the xen-folks for
	xen-3.1.0. I know of no way to reliably detect the version of XenD
	(user space tools), which may be different from the version of the
	hypervisor (kernel) version! Because of this only the change from
	'utc'/'localtime' to 'variable' in XenD-3.1 is handled, not the buggy
	behaviour of XenD-3.1 until XenD-3.4.

	For backward compatibility with previous versions of libvirt Xen-HV
	still accepts 'utc' and 'localtime', but they are returned as 'variable'
	on the next read-back from Xend to libvirt, since this is what XenD
	implements: The RTC is NOT reset back to the specified time on next
	restart, but the previous offset is kept.
	This behaviour can be turned off by adding the additional attribute
	adjustment='reset', in which case libvirt will report an error instead
	of doing the conversion. The attribute can also be used as a shortcut to
	offset='variable' with basis='...'.

	With these changes, it is also necessary to adjust the xen tests:

	"localtime = 0" is always inserted, because otherwise on updates the
	value is not changed within XenD.

	adjustment='reset' is inserted for all cases, since they're all <
	XEND_CONFIG_VERSION_3_1_0, only 3.1 introduced persistent
	rtc_timeoffset.

	Some statements change their order because code was moved around.

2012-04-02  Philipp Hahn  <hahn@univention.de>

	Support clock=variable relative to localtime
	Since Xen 3.1 the clock=variable semantic is supported. In addition to
	qemu/kvm Xen also knows about a variant where the offset is relative to
	'localtime' instead of 'utc'.

	Extends the libvirt structure with a flag 'basis' to specify, if the
	offset is relative to 'localtime' or 'utc'.

	Extends the libvirt structure with a flag 'reset' to force the reset
	behaviour of 'localtime' and 'utc'; this is needed for backward
	compatibility with previous versions of libvirt, since they report
	incorrect XML.

	Adapt the only user 'qemu' to the new name.
	Extend the RelaxNG schema accordingly.
	Document the new 'basis' attribute in the HTML documentation.
	Adapt test for the new attribute.

	qemu: fix memory leak in virDomainGetVcpus
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=808979

	The leak is really in virProcessInfoGetAffinity, as shown in the
	valgrind output given in the above bug report - it calls CPU_ALLOC(),
	but then fails to call CPU_FREE().

	This leak has existed in every version of libvirt since 0.7.5.

	conf: allow fuzz in XML with cur balloon > max
	Commit 1b1402b introduced a regression.  Since older libvirt versions
	would silently round memory up (until the previous patch), but populated
	current memory based on querying the guest, it was possible to have
	dumpxml show cur > max by the amount of the rounding.  For example, if
	a user requested 1048570 KiB memory (just shy of 1GiB), the qemu
	driver would actually run with 1048576 KiB, and libvirt 0.9.10 would
	output a current that was 6KiB larger than the maximum.  Situations
	where this could have an impact include, but are not limited to,
	migration from old to new libvirt, managedsave in old libvirt and
	start in new libvirt, snapshot creation in old libvirt and revert in
	new libvirt - without this patch, the new libvirt would reject the
	VM because of the rounding discrepancy.

	Fix things by adding a fuzz factor, and silently clamp current down to
	maximum in that case, rather than failing to reparse XML for an existing
	VM.  From a practical standpoint, this has no user impact: 'virsh
	dumpxml' will continue to query the running guest rather than rely on
	the incoming xml, which will see the currect current value, and even if
	clamping down occurs during parsing, it will be by at most the fuzz
	factor of a megabyte alignment, and rounded back up when passed back to
	the hypervisor.

	Meanwhile, we continue to reject cur > max if the difference is beyond
	the fuzz factor of nearest megabyte.  But this is not a real change in
	behavior, since with 0.9.10, even though the parser allowed it, later
	in the processing stream we would reject it at the qemu layer; so
	rejecting it in the parser just moves error detection to a nicer place.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c (virDomainDefParseXML): Don't reject
	existing XML.
	Based on a report by Zhou Peng.

	qemu: reflect any memory rounding back to xml
	If we round up a user's memory request, we should update the XML
	to reflect the actual value in use by the VM, rather than giving
	an artificially small value back to the user.

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c (qemuBuildNumaArgStr)

	python: improve conversion validation
	Laszlo Ersek pointed out that in trying to convert a long to an
	unsigned int, we used:

	long long_val = ...;
	if ((unsigned int)long_val == long_val)

	According to C99 integer promotion rules, the if statement is
	equivalent to:

	(unsigned long)(unsigned int)long_val == (unsigned long)long_val

	since you get an unsigned comparison if at least one side is
	unsigned, using the largest rank of the two sides; but on 32-bit
	platforms, where unsigned long and unsigned int are the same size,
	this comparison is always true and ends up converting negative
	long_val into posigive unsigned int values, rather than rejecting
	the negative value as we had originally intended (python longs
	are unbounded size, and we don't want to do silent modulo
	arithmetic when converting to C code).

	Fix this by using direct comparisons, rather than casting.

	* python/typewrappers.c (libvirt_intUnwrap, libvirt_uintUnwrap)
	(libvirt_ulongUnwrap, libvirt_ulonglongUnwrap): Fix conversion
	checks.

	Refactor the libvirt RPM daemon pieces
	There are a number of flaws with our packaging of the libvirtd
	daemon:

	 - Installing 'libvirt' does not install 'qemu-kvm' or 'xen'
	   etc which are required to actually run the hypervisor in
	   question
	 - Installing 'libvirt' pulls in the default configuration
	   files which may not be wanted & cause problems if installed
	   inside a guest
	 - It is not possible to explicitly required all the peices
	   required to manage a specific hypervisor

	This change takes the 'libvirt' RPM and and changes it thus

	 - libvirt: just a virtual package with dep on libvirt-daemon,
	   libvirt-daemon-config-network & libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter
	 - libvirt-daemon: the libvirt daemon and related pieces
	 - libvirt-daemon-config-network: the default network config
	 - libvirt-daemon-config-nwfilter: the network filter configs
	 - libvirt-docs: the website HTML

	We then introduce some more virtual (empty) packages

	 - libvirt-daemon-qemu: Deps on libvirt-daemon & 'qemu'
	 - libvirt-daemon-kvm: Deps on libvirt-daemon & 'qemu-kvm'
	 - libvirt-daemon-lxc: Deps on libvirt-daemon
	 - libvirt-daemon-uml: Deps on libvirt-daemon
	 - libvirt-daemon-xen: Deps on libvirt-daemon & 'xen'

	 - libvirt-qemu: Deps on libvirt-daemon-qemu & libvirt-daemon-config-{network,nwfilter}
	 - libvirt-kvm: Deps on libvirt-daemon-kvm & libvirt-daemon-config-{network,nwfilter}
	 - libvirt-lxc: Deps on libvirt-daemon-lxc & libvirt-daemon-config-{network,nwfilter}
	 - libvirt-uml: Deps on libvirt-daemon-uml & libvirt-daemon-config-{network,nwfilter}
	 - libvirt-xen: Deps on libvirt-daemon-xen & libvirt-daemon-config-network

	My intent in the future is to turn on the driver modules by
	default, at which time 'libvirt-daemon' will cease to include
	any specific drivers, instead we'll get libvirt-daemon-driver-XXXX
	packages for each driver. The libvirt-daemon-XXX packages will
	then pull in each driver that they require.

	It is recommended that applications required a locally installed
	libvirtd daemon, use either 'Requires: libvirt-daemon-XXXX' or
	'Requires: libvirt-XXX' and *not* "Requires: libvirt-daemon"
	or 'Requires: libvirt'

	* libvirt.spec.in: Refactor RPMs
	* docs/packaging.html.in, docs/sitemap.html.in: Document
	  new RPM split rationale

	qemu: support live change of the bridge used by a guest network device
	This patch was created to resolve this upstream bug:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=784767

	and is at least a partial solution to this RHEL RFE:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=805071

	Previously the only attribute of a network device that could be
	modified by virUpdateDeviceFlags() ("virsh update-device") was the
	link state; attempts to change any other attribute would log an error
	and fail.

	This patch adds recognition of a change in bridge device name, and
	supports reconnecting the guest's interface to the new device.
	Standard audit logs for detaching and attaching a network device are
	also generated. Although the current auditing function doesn't log the
	bridge being attached to, this will later be changed in a separate
	patch.

	build: fix mingw ssize_t, syntax check
	We are so close to a release that we don't want to pull in a
	gnulib submodule update and risk regressions, since there has
	been a lot of other gnulib churn upstream.  However, there are
	a couple of gnulib issues that are worth fixing in isolation,
	by applying local patches to gnulib.

	There was an upstream gnulib bug in maint.mk that rendered most
	of our syntax checks ineffective (and fixing it flushed out a
	minor bug in our code):
	https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2012-03/msg00194.html

	There is still an upstream bug where gnulib uses the wrong type
	for ssize_t on mingw; we need the fix now even though it has not
	yet been accepted into gnulib:

	qemu: eliminate nested switch, simplify code
	qemuBuildHostNetStr had a switch-within-a-switch where both were
	looking at the same variable. This was apparently to take advantage of
	code common to three different cases (while also taking care of some
	code that was different). However, there were only 2 lines common to
	all, one of those can be eliminated by merging it into the
	virAsprintfs that are in each case. On top of that, all the extra
	empty cases cause Coverity complaints (because they are unreachable),
	but absence of the empty cases causes a compile error due to
	"enumeration value not handled in switch".

	The solution is to just make each toplevel case independent, folding
	in the common code to each.

	Revert "Set default name for SPICE agent channel"
	This patch reverts commit b0e2bb3. Its functionality has been replaced
	by commit 3269ee6.

2012-03-31  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: set default name for SPICE agent channel when generating command
	commit b0e2bb33 set a default value for the SPICE agent channel by
	inserting it during parsing of the channel XML. That method of setting
	a default is problematic because it makes a format/parse roundtrip
	unclean, and experience with setting other values as a side effect of
	parsing has led to headaches (e.g. automatically setting a MAC address
	in the parser when one isn't specified in the input XML).

	This patch does not revert commit b0e2bb33 (it will be reverted in a
	separate patch) but adds the alternate implementation of simply
	inserting the default value in the appropriate place on the qemu
	commandline when no value is provided.

	Set default name for SPICE agent channel
	libvirt documentation for channels with type 'spicevmc' says that the
	'target' child node has:
	"an optional attribute name controls how the guest will have access
	 to the channel, and defaults to name='com.redhat.spice.0'."

	However, this default value is never set in libvirt code base,
	there's only a check in qemu_command.c to error out if the name
	attribute doesn't have the expected value (if it's set).

	This commit sets a default target name for spicevmc channels during
	the domain configuration parsing so that the code agrees with the

	snapshot: don't pass NULL to QMP command creation
	Commit d42a2ff caused a regression in creating a disk-only snapshot
	of a qcow2 disk; by passing the wrong variable to the monitor call,
	libvirt ended up creating JSON that looked like "format":null instead
	of the intended "format":"qcow2".

	To make it easier to diagnose this in the future, make JSON creation
	error out if "s:arg" is paired with NULL (it is still possible to
	use "n:arg" in the rare cases where qemu will accept a null).

	(qemuDomainSnapshotCreateSingleDiskActive): Pass correct value.

	build: fix "missing initializer" error in qemu_process.c
	Found when attempting to build on Fedora 17 alpha with:

	   ./autogen.sh --system --enable-compile-warnings=error

	(this same build command works without problem on Fedora 16). Since
	the consumer of the qemuProcessReconnectData doesn't assume that the
	other fields of the struct are initialized (although it uses them
	internally), the simpler solution is to just switch to C99-style
	struct initialization (which doesn't require specification of all

	build: avoid frame size error when building without -O2
	libvirt always adds -Werror-frame-larger-than=4096 to the flags when
	it builds. When building on Fedora 17, two functions with multiple
	1024 buffers declared inside if {} blocks would generate frame size
	errors; apparently the version of gcc on Fedora 16 will merge these
	multiple buffers into a single buffer even when optimization is off,
	but Fedora 17 won't.

	The fix is to declare a single 1024 buffer at the top of the two
	offending functions, and reuse the single buffer throughout the
	functions.

	Cleanup for a return statement in source files
	Return statements with parameter enclosed in parentheses were modified
	and parentheses were removed. The whole change was scripted, here is how:

	List of files was obtained using this command:
	git grep -l -e '\<return\s*([^()]*\(([^()]*)[^()]*\)*)\s*;' |             \
	grep -e '\.[ch]$' -e '\.py$'

	Found files were modified with this command:
	sed -i -e                                                                 \

	-e 's_^\(.*\<return\)\s*(\([^()]*\))\s*\(;.*$\)_\1 \2\3_'

	Then checked for nonsense.

	The whole command looks like this:
	git grep -l -e '\<return\s*([^()]*\(([^()]*)[^()]*\)*)\s*;' |             \
	grep -e '\.[ch]$' -e '\.py$' | xargs sed -i -e                            \

	snapshot: improve qemu handling of reused snapshot targets
	The oVirt developers have stated that the real reasons they want
	to have qemu reuse existing volumes when creating a snapshot are:
	1. the management framework is set up so that creation has to be
	done from a central node for proper resource tracking, and having
	libvirt and/or qemu create things violates the framework, and
	2. qemu defaults to creating snapshots with an absolute path to
	the backing file, but oVirt wants to manage a backing chain that
	uses just relative names, to allow for easier migration of a chain
	across storage locations.

	When 0.9.10 added VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REUSE_EXT (commit
	4e9953a4), it only addressed point 1, but libvirt was still using
	O_TRUNC which violates point 2.  Meanwhile, the new qemu
	'transaction' monitor command includes a new optional mode argument
	that will force qemu to reuse the metadata of the file it just
	opened (with the burden on the caller to have valid metadata there
	in the first place).  So, this tweaks the meaning of the flag to
	cover both points as intended for use by oVirt.  It is not strictly
	backward-compatible to 0.9.10 behavior, but it can be argued that
	the O_TRUNC of 0.9.10 was a bug.

	Note that this flag is all-or-nothing, and only selects between
	'existing' and the default 'absolute-paths'.  A more flexible
	approach that would allow per-disk selections, as well as adding
	support for the 'no-backing-file' mode, would be possible by
	extending the <domainsnapshot> xml to have a per-disk mode, but
	until we have a management application expressing a need for that
	additional complexity, it is not worth doing.

	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Tweak documentation.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h (qemuMonitorDiskSnapshot): Add
	parameters.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h (qemuMonitorJSONDiskSnapshot):

	snapshot: add support for qemu transaction command
	QEmu 1.1 is adding a 'transaction' command to the JSON monitor.
	Each element of a transaction corresponds to a top-level command,
	with the additional guarantee that the transaction flushes all
	pending I/O, then guarantees that all actions will be successful
	as a group or that failure will roll back the state to what it
	was before the monitor command.  The difference between a
	top-level command:

	{ "execute": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "arguments":
	  { "device": "virtio0", ... } }

	and a transaction:

	{ "execute": "transaction", "arguments":
	  { "actions": [
	    { "type": "blockdev-snapshot-sync", "data":
	      { "device": "virtio0", ... } } ] } }

	is just a couple of changed key names and nesting the shorter
	command inside a JSON array to the longer command.  This patch
	just adds the framework; the next patch will actually use a
	transaction.

	snapshot: rudimentary qemu support for atomic disk snapshot
	Taking an external snapshot of just one disk is atomic, without having
	to pause and resume the VM.  This also paves the way for later patches
	to interact with the new qemu 'transaction' monitor command.

	The various scenarios when requesting atomic are:
	online, 1 disk, old qemu - safe, allowed by this patch
	online, more than 1 disk, old qemu - failure, this patch
	offline snapshot - safe, once a future patch implements offline disk snapshot
	online, 1 or more disks, new qemu - safe, once future patch uses transaction

	Taking an online system checkpoint snapshot is atomic, since it is
	done via a single 'savevm' monitor command.  Taking an offline system
	checkpoint snapshot is atomic, thanks to the previous patch.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Support
	new flag for single-disk setups.
	(qemuDomainSnapshotDiskPrepare): Check for atomic here.
	(qemuDomainSnapshotCreateDiskActive): Skip pausing the VM when

2012-03-24  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: add atomic create flag
	Right now, it is appallingly easy to cause qemu disk snapshots
	to alter a domain then fail; for example, by requesting a two-disk
	snapshot where the second disk name resides on read-only storage.
	In this failure scenario, libvirt reports failure, but modifies
	the live domain XML in-place to record that the first disk snapshot
	was taken; and places a difficult burden on the management app
	to grab the XML and reparse it to see which disks, if any, were
	altered by the partial snapshot.

	This patch adds a new flag where implementations can request that
	the hypervisor make snapshots atomically; either no changes to
	XML occur, or all disks were altered as a group.  If you request
	the flag, you either get outright failure up front, or you take
	advantage of hypervisor abilities to make an atomic snapshot. Of
	course, drivers should prefer the atomic means even without the
	flag explicitly requested.

	There's no way to make snapshots 100% bulletproof - even if the
	hypervisor does it perfectly atomic, we could run out of memory
	during the followup tasks of updating our in-memory XML, and report
	a failure.  However, these sorts of catastrophic failures are rare
	and unlikely, and it is still nicer to know that either all
	snapshots happened or none of them, as that is an easier state to
	recover from.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in
	(VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_ATOMIC): New flag.
	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Document it.

	qemu: Avoid dangling migration-out job when client dies
	When a client which started non-p2p migration dies in a bad time, the
	source libvirtd never clears the migration job and almost nothing can be
	done with the domain without restarting the daemon. This patch makes use
	of connection close callbacks and ensures that migration job is properly
	discarded when the client disconnects.

	qemu: Make autodestroy utilize connection close callbacks

	qemu: Add connection close callbacks
	Add support for registering arbitrary callback to be called for a domain
	when a connection gets closed.

	qemu: Avoid dangling migration-in job on shutoff domains
	Destination daemon should not rely on the client or source daemon
	(depending on the type of migration) to call Finish when migration
	fails, because the client may crash before it can do so. The domain
	prepared for incoming migration is set to be destroyed (and migration
	job cleaned up) when connection with the client closes but this is not
	enough. If the associated qemu process crashes after Prepare step and
	the domain is cleaned up before the connection gets closed, autodestroy
	is not called for the domain and migration jobs remains set. In case the
	domain is defined on destination host (i.e., it is not completely
	removed once destroyed) we keep the job set for ever. To fix this, we
	register a cleanup callback which is responsible to clean migration-in
	job when a domain dies anywhere between Prepare and Finish steps. Note
	that we can't blindly clean any job when spotting EOF on monitor since
	normally an API is running at that time.

	qemu: Add support for domain cleanup callbacks
	Add support for registering cleanup callbacks to be run when a domain
	transitions to shutoff state.

	qemu: Use unlimited speed when migrating to file
	This reverts commit 61f2b6ba5fdef0613d6351b99913b5ef468144ce and most of
	commit d8916dc8e2f612ab3ce46f32c4bfeb0bd73f6007, which effectively
	brings back commit ef1065cf5acad13767c054758cbe7f4e8af5d241 written by
	Jim Fehlig:

	The qemu migration speed default is 32MiB/s as defined in migration.c

	/* Migration speed throttling */
	static int64_t max_throttle = (32 << 20);

	There's no need to throttle migration when targeting a file, so set
	migration speed to unlimited prior to migration, and restore to libvirt
	default value after migration.

	Default units is MB for migrate_set_speed monitor command, so
	(INT64_MAX / (1024 * 1024)) is used for unlimited migration speed.

	This was reverted because migration to file could not be canceled and
	even monitored since qemu was not processing any monitor commands until
	the migration finished. This is now different as we make sure the
	file descriptor we pass to qemu is able to properly report EAGAIN.
	Recent qemu changes might have helped as well.

	I tested managedsave with this patch in and indeed, it is 10x faster
	while I can still monitor its progress.

	conf: forbid use of multicast mac addresses
	A few times libvirt users manually setting mac addresses have
	complained of a networking failure that ends up being due to a multicast
	mac address being used for a guest interface. This patch prevents that
	by logging an error and failing if a multicast mac address is
	encountered in each of the three following cases:

	1) domain xml <interface> mac address.
	2) network xml bridge mac address.
	3) network xml dhcp/host mac address.

	There are several other places where a mac address can be input that
	aren't controlled in this manner because failure to do so has no
	consequences (e.g., if the address will be used to search through
	existing interfaces for a match).

	The RNG has been updated to add multiMacAddr and uniMacAddr along with
	the existing macAddr, and macAddr was switched to uniMacAddr where
	appropriate.

2012-03-20  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: return immediately on error in dhcp host element
	If an error was encountered parsing a dhcp host entry mac address or

	This patch returns immediately on logging the first error.

	util: fail attempts to use same mac address for guest and tap
	This patch is in response to:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=798467

	If a guest's tap device is created using the same MAC address the
	guest uses for its own network card (which connects to the tap
	device), the Linux kernel will log the following message and traffic
	will not pass:

	 kernel: vnet9: received packet with own address as source address

	This patch disallows MAC addresses with a first byte of 0xFE, but only in
	the case that the MAC address is used for a guest interface that's
	connected by way of a standard tap device. (In other words, the
	validation is done at runtime at the same place the MAC address is
	modified for the tap device, rather than when mac address is parsed,
	the idea being that it is then we know for sure the address will be
	problematic.)

	snapshot: make quiesce a bit safer
	If a guest is paused, we were silently ignoring the quiesce flag,
	which results in unclean snapshots, contrary to the intent of the
	flag.  Since we can't quiesce without guest agent support, we should
	instead fail if the guest is not running.

	Meanwhile, if we attempt a quiesce command, but the guest agent
	doesn't respond, and we time out, we may have left the command
	pending on the guest's queue, and when the guest resumes parsing
	commands, it will freeze even though our command is no longer
	around to issue a thaw.  To be safe, we must _always_ pair every
	quiesce call with a counterpart thaw, even if the quiesce call
	failed due to a timeout, so that if a guest wakes up and starts
	processing a command backlog, it will not get stuck in a frozen
	state.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotCreateDiskActive):
	Always issue thaw after a quiesce, even if quiesce failed.
	(qemuDomainSnapshotFSThaw): Add a parameter.

	Fix handling of blkio deviceWeight empty string
	A common coding pattern for changing blkio parameters is

	  1. virDomainGetBlkioParameters

	  2. change one or more params

	  3. virDomainSetBlkioParameters

	For this to work, it must be possible to roundtrip through
	the methods without error. Unfortunately virDomainGetBlkioParameters
	will return "" for the deviceWeight parameter for guests by default,
	which virDomainSetBlkioParameters will then reject as invalid.

	This fixes the handling of "" to be a no-op, and also improves the
	error message to tell you what was invalid

	qemu: Support numad
	numad is an user-level daemon that monitors NUMA topology and
	processes resource consumption to facilitate good NUMA resource
	alignment of applications/virtual machines to improve performance
	and minimize cost of remote memory latencies. It provides a
	pre-placement advisory interface, so significant processes can
	be pre-bound to nodes with sufficient available resources.

	More details: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/numad

	"numad -w ncpus:memory_amount" is the advisory interface numad
	provides currently.

	This patch add the support by introducing a new XML attribute
	for <vcpu>. e.g.

	  <vcpu placement="auto">4</vcpu>
	  <vcpu placement="static" cpuset="1-10^6">4</vcpu>

	The returned advisory nodeset from numad will be printed
	in domain's dumped XML. e.g.
	  <vcpu placement="auto" cpuset="1-10^6">4</vcpu>

	If placement is "auto", the number of vcpus and the current
	memory amount specified in domain XML will be used for numad
	command line (numad uses MB for memory amount):
	  numad -w $num_of_vcpus:$current_memory_amount / 1024

	The advisory nodeset returned from numad will be used to set
	domain process CPU affinity then. (e.g. qemuProcessInitCpuAffinity).

	If the user specifies both CPU affinity policy (e.g.
	(<vcpu cpuset="1-10,^7,^8">4</vcpu>) and placement == "auto"
	the specified CPU affinity will be overridden.

	Only QEMU/KVM drivers support it now.

	qemu: fix segfault when detaching non-existent network device
	In qemuDomainDetachNetDevice, detach was being used before it had been
	validated. If no matching device was found, this resulted in a
	dereference of a NULL pointer.

	This behavior was a regression introduced in commit
	cf90342be0022520e25cfa258cef1034b229a100, so it has not been a part of
	any official libvirt release.

	qemu: eliminate memory leak in qemuDomainUpdateDeviceConfig
	This function was freeing a virDomainNetDef with

	virDomainNetDefFree() must be called instead, otherwise several

	qemu: support persistent hotplug of <hostdev> devices

	qemuDomainAttachDeviceConfig and qemuDomainDetachDeviceConfig.

2012-03-09  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	util: standardize return from functions calling virNetlinkCommand
	There are several functions that call virNetlinkCommand, and they all
	follow a common pattern, with three exit labels: err_exit (or
	cleanup), malformed_resp, and buffer_too_small. All three of these
	labels do their own cleanup and have their own return. However, the
	malformed_resp label usually frees the same items as the
	cleanup/err_exit label, and the buffer_too_small label just doesn't
	free recvbuf (because it's known to always be NULL at the time we goto
	buffer_too_small.

	In order to simplify and standardize the code, I've made the following
	changes to all of these functions:

	1) err_exit is replaced with the more libvirt-ish "cleanup", which
	   makes sense because in all cases this code is also executed in the
	   case of success, so labelling it err_exit may be confusing.

	2) rc is initialized to -1, and set to 0 just before the cleanup
	   label. Any code that currently sets rc = -1 is made to instead goto
	   cleanup.

	3) malformed_resp and buffer_too_small just log their error and goto
	   cleanup. This gives us a single return path, and a single place to
	   free up resources.

	4) In one instance, rather then logging an error immediately, a char*
	   msg was pointed to an error string, then goto cleanup (and cleanup
	   would log an error if msg != NULL). It takes no more lines of code
	   to just log the message as we encounter it.

	This patch should have 0 functional effects.

	util: eliminate device object leaks related to virDomain*Remove*()
	There are several functions in domain_conf.c that remove a device
	object from the domain's list of that object type, but don't free the
	object or return it to the caller to free. In many cases this isn't a
	problem because the caller already had a pointer to the object and
	frees it afterward, but in several cases the removed object was just
	left floating around with no references to it.

	In particular, the function qemuDomainDetachDeviceConfig() calls
	functions to locate and remove net (virDomainNetRemoveByMac), disk
	(virDomainDiskRemoveByName()), and lease (virDomainLeaseRemove())
	devices, but neither it nor its caller qemuDomainModifyDeviceConfig()
	ever obtain a pointer to the device being removed, much less free it.

	This patch modifies the following "remove" functions to return a
	pointer to the device object being removed from the domain device
	arrays, to give the caller the option of freeing the device object
	using that pointer if needed. In places where the object was
	previously leaked, it is now freed:

	  virDomainDiskRemove
	  virDomainDiskRemoveByName
	  virDomainNetRemove
	  virDomainNetRemoveByMac
	  virDomainHostdevRemove
	  virDomainLeaseRemove
	  virDomainLeaseRemoveAt

	The functions that had been leaking:

	  libxlDomainDetachConfig - leaked a virDomainDiskDef
	  qemuDomainDetachDeviceConfig - could leak a virDomainDiskDef,
	                            a virDomainNetDef, or a
	                            virDomainLeaseDef
	  qemuDomainDetachLease   - leaked a virDomainLeaseDef

	qemu: don't 'remove' hostdev objects from domain if operation fails
	There were certain paths through the hostdev detach code that could
	lead to the lower level function failing (and not removing the object
	from the domain's hostdevs list), but the higher level function
	free'ing the hostdev object anyway. This would leave a stale
	hostdevdef pointer in the list, which would surely cause a problem
	eventually.

	This patch relocates virDomainHostdevRemove from the lower level
	functions qemuDomainDetachThisHostDevice and
	qemuDomainDetachHostPciDevice, to their caller
	qemuDomainDetachThisHostDevice, placing it just before the call to
	virDomainHostdevDefFree. This makes it easy to verify that either both
	operations are done, or neither.

	NB: The "dangling pointer" part of this problem was introduced in
	commit 13d5a6, so it is not present in libvirt versions prior to
	0.9.9. Earlier versions would return failure in certain cases even
	though the the device object was removed/deleted, but the removal and
	deletion operations would always both happen or neither.

	util: consolidate duplicated error messages in virnetlink.c
	There are special stub versions of all public functions in this file
	that are compiled when either libnl isn't available or the platform
	isn't linux. Each of these functions had two almost identical message,
	differing only in the function name included in the message. Since log
	messages already contain the function name, we can just define a const
	char* with the common part of the string, and use that same string for
	all the log messages.

	Also, rather than doing #if defined ... #else ... #endif *inside the
	error log macro invocation*, this patch does #if defined ... just
	once, using it to decide which single string to define. This turns the
	error log in each function from 6 lines, to 1 line.

	qemu: Don't parse device twice in attach/detach
	Some members are generated during XML parse (e.g. MAC address of

	we parse given XML twice: first time for live, second for config.
	This is wrong then as the second time we are not guaranteed

	To prevent that we need to create a copy of DeviceDefPtr;

	xml: use long long internally, to centralize overflow checks
	On 64-bit platforms, unsigned long and unsigned long long are
	identical, so we don't have to worry about overflow checks.
	On 32-bit platforms, anywhere we narrow unsigned long long back
	to unsigned long, we have to worry about overflow; it's easier
	to do this in one place by having most of the code use the same
	or wider types, and only doing the narrowing at the last minute.
	Therefore, the memory set commands remain unsigned long, and
	the memory get command now centralizes the overflow check into
	libvirt.c, so that drivers don't have to repeat the work.

	This also fixes a bug where xen returned the wrong value on

	xml: drop unenforced minimum memory limit from RNG
	The test domain allows <memory>0</memory>, but the RNG was stating

	storage: support more scaling suffixes
	Disk manufacturers are fond of quoting sizes in powers of 10,
	rather than powers of 2 (after all, 2.1 GB sounds larger than
	2.0 GiB, even though the exact opposite is true).  So, we might
	as well follow coreutils' lead in supporting three types of
	suffix: single letter ${u} (which we already had) and ${u}iB
	for the power of 2, and ${u}B for power of 10.

	Additionally, it is impossible to create a file with more than
	2**63 bytes, since off_t is signed (if you have enough storage
	to even create one 8EiB file, I'm jealous).  This now reports
	failure up front rather than down the road when the kernel

	xml: output memory unit for clarity
	Make it obvious to 'dumpxml' readers what unit we are using,
	since our default of KiB for memory (1024) differs from qemu's
	default of MiB; and differs from our use of bytes for storage.

	Tests were updated via:

	$ find tests/*data tests/*out -name '*.xml' | \
	  xargs sed -i 's/<\(memory\|currentMemory\|hard_limit\|soft_limit\|min_guarantee\|swap_hard_limit\)>/<\1 unit='"'KiB'>/"
	$ find tests/*data tests/*out -name '*.xml' | \
	  xargs sed -i 's/<\(capacity\|allocation\|available\)>/<\1 unit='"'bytes'>/"

	followed by a few fixes for the stragglers.

	Note that with this patch, the RNG for <memory> still forbids
	validation of anything except unit='KiB', since the code silently
	ignores the attribute; a later patch will expand <memory> to allow

	xml: share 'unit' in RNG
	The code supported unit='E' for "exabyte", but the RNG did not;
	conversely, the RNG supported "z" and "y" but the code did not
	(I'm jealous if you have that much storage, particularly since
	it won't fit in 64-bit off_t).  Also, the code supported
	<allocation unit='...'>, but not the RNG.

	In an effort to make 'unit' more worthwhile in future patches,
	it's easier to share it between files.

	In making this factorization, note that absFilePath is more

	will now validate with a wider set of file names than before.

	rpc: allow truncated return for virDomainGetCPUStats
	The RPC code assumed that the array returned by the driver would be
	fully populated; that is, ncpus on entry resulted in ncpus * return
	value on exit.  However, while we don't support holes in the middle
	of ncpus, we do want to permit the case of ncpus on entry being
	longer than the array returned by the driver (that is, it should be
	safe for the caller to pass ncpus=128 on entry, and the driver will
	stop populating the array when it hits max_id).

	Additionally, a successful return implies that the caller will then
	use virTypedParamArrayClear on the entire array; for this to not
	free uninitialized memory, the driver must ensure that all skipped
	entries are explicitly zeroed (the RPC driver did this, but not
	the qemu driver).

	There are now three cases:
	server 0.9.10 and client 0.9.10 or newer: No impact - there were no
	hypervisor drivers that supported cpu stats

	server 0.9.11 or newer and client 0.9.10: if the client calls with
	ncpus beyond the max, then the rpc call will fail on the client side
	and disconnect the client, but the server is no worse for the wear

	server 0.9.11 or newer and client 0.9.11: the server can return a
	truncated array and the client will do just fine

	I reproduced the problem by using a host with 2 CPUs, and doing:
	virsh cpu-stats $dom --start 1 --count 2

	* daemon/remote.c (remoteDispatchDomainGetCPUStats): Allow driver
	to omit tail of array.

	qemu: install port profile and mac address on netdev hostdevs
	These changes are applied only if the hostdev has a parent net device
	(i.e. if it was defined as "<interface type='hostdev'>" rather than
	just "<hostdev>").  If the parent netdevice has virtual port
	information, the original virtualport associate functions are called
	(these set and restore both mac and port profile on an
	interface). Otherwise, only mac address is set on the device.

	Note that This is only supported for SR-IOV Virtual Functions (not for
	standard PCI or USB netdevs), and virtualport association is only
	supported for 802.1Qbh. For all other types of cards and types of
	virtualport, a "Config Unsupported" error is returned and the

	 - Adds a vf argument to all port profile functions.

	For 802.1Qbh devices, the port profile calls can use a vf argument if
	passed by the caller. If the vf argument is -1 it will try to derive the vf
	if the device passed is a virtual function.

	For 802.1Qbg devices, This patch introduces a null check for the device

	can be null.

	qemu: support type=hostdev network device live hotplug attach/detach
	qemuDomainAttachNetDevice

	  - re-ordered some things at start of function because
	    networkAllocateActualDevice should always be run and a slot
	    in def->nets always allocated, but host_net_add isn't needed
	    if the actual type is hostdev.

	  - if actual type is hostdev, defer to
	    qemuDomainAttachHostDevice (which will reach up to the NetDef
	    for things like MAC address when necessary). After return
	    from qemuDomainAttachHostDevice, slip directly to cleanup,
	    since the rest of the function is specific to emulated net
	    devices.

	  - put assignment of new NetDef into expanded def->nets down
	    below cleanup: (but only on success) since it is also needed
	    for emulated and hostdev net devices.

	qemuDomainDetachHostDevice

	  - after locating the exact device to detach, check if it's a
	    network device and, if so, use toplevel
	    qemuDomainDetachNetDevice instead so that the def->nets list
	    is properly updated, and 'actual device' properly returned to
	    network pool if appropriate. Otherwise, for normal hostdevs,
	    call the lower level qemuDomainDetachThisDevice.

	qemuDomainDetachNetDevice

	  - This is where it gets a bit tricky. After locating the device
	    on the def->nets list, if the network device type == hostdev,
	    call the *lower level* qemuDomainDetachThisDevice (which will
	    reach back up to the parent net device for MAC address /
	    virtualport when appropriate, then clear the device out of
	    def->hostdevs) before skipping past all the emulated
	    net-device-specific code to cleanup:, where the network
	    device is removed from def->nets, and the network device
	    object is freed.

	In short, any time a hostdev-type network device is detached, we must
	go through the toplevel virDomaineDetachNetDevice function first and
	last, to make sure 1) the def->nnets list is properly managed, and 2)
	any device allocated with networkAllocateActualDevice is properly
	freed. At the same time, in the middle we need to go through the
	lower-level vidDomainDetach*This*HostDevice to be sure that 1) the
	def->hostdevs list is properly managed, 2) the PCI device is properly
	detached from the guest and reattached to the host (if appropriate),
	and 3) any higher level teardown is called at the appropriate time, by
	reaching back up to the NetDef config (part (3) will be covered in a
	separate patch).

2012-03-06  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: support type='hostdev' network devices at domain start
	This patch makes sure that each network device ("interface") of
	type='hostdev' appears on both the hostdevs list and the nets list of
	the virDomainDef, and it modifies the qemu driver startup code so that
	these devices will be presented to qemu on the commandline as hostdevs
	rather than as network devices.

	It does not add support for hotplug of these type of devices, or code
	to honor the <mac address> or <virtualport> given in the config (both
	of those will be done in separate patches).

	Once each device is placed on both lists, much of what this patch does
	is modify places in the code that traverse all the device lists so
	that these hybrid devices are only acted on once - either along with
	the other hostdevs, or along with the other network interfaces. (In
	many cases, only one of the lists is traversed / a specific operation
	is performed on only one type of device. In those instances, the code
	can remain unchanged.)

	There is one special case - when building the commandline, interfaces
	are allowed to proceed all the way through
	networkAllocateActualDevice() before deciding to skip the rest of
	netdev-specific processing - this is so that (once we have support for
	networks with pools of hostdev devices) we can get the actual device
	allocated, then rely on the loop processing all hostdevs to generate
	the correct commandline.

	(NB: <interface type='hostdev'> is only supported for PCI network
	devices that are SR-IOV Virtual Functions (VF). Standard PCI[e] and
	USB devices, and even the Physical Functions (PF) of SR-IOV devices
	can only be assigned to a guest using the more basic <hostdev> device
	entry. This limitation is mostly due to the fact that non-SR-IOV
	ethernet devices tend to lose mac address configuration whenever the
	card is reset, which happens when a card is assigned to a guest;
	SR-IOV VFs fortunately don't suffer the same problem.)

2012-03-06  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: parse/format type='hostdev' network interfaces
	This is the new interface type that sets up an SR-IOV PCI network
	device to be assigned to the guest with PCI passthrough after
	initializing some network device-specific things from the config
	(e.g. MAC address, virtualport profile parameters). Here is an example
	of the syntax:

	  <interface type='hostdev' managed='yes'>
	    <source>
	      <address type='pci' domain='0' bus='0' slot='4' function='3'/>
	    </source>
	    <mac address='00:11:22:33:44:55'/>
	    <address type='pci' domain='0' bus='0' slot='7' function='0'/>
	  </interface>

	This would assign the PCI card from bus 0 slot 4 function 3 on the
	host, to bus 0 slot 7 function 0 on the guest, but would first set the
	MAC address of the card to 00:11:22:33:44:55.

	NB: The parser and formatter don't care if the PCI card being
	specified is a standard single function network adapter, or a virtual
	function (VF) of an SR-IOV capable network adapter, but the upcoming
	code that implements the back end of this config will work *only* with
	SR-IOV VFs. This is because modifying the mac address of a standard
	network adapter prior to assigning it to a guest is pointless - part
	of the device reset that occurs during that process will reset the MAC
	address to the value programmed into the card's firmware.

	Although it's not supported by any of libvirt's hypervisor drivers,
	usb network hostdevs are also supported in the parser and formatter
	for completeness and consistency. <source> syntax is identical to that
	for plain <hostdev> devices, except that the <address> element should
	have "type='usb'" added if bus/device are specified:

	  <interface type='hostdev'>
	    <source>
	      <address type='usb' bus='0' device='4'/>
	    </source>
	    <mac address='00:11:22:33:44:55'/>
	  </interface>

	If the vendor/product form of usb specification is used, type='usb'
	is implied:

	  <interface type='hostdev'>
	    <source>
	      <vendor id='0x0012'/>
	      <product id='0x24dd'/>
	    </source>
	    <mac address='00:11:22:33:44:55'/>
	  </interface>

	Again, the upcoming patch to fill in the backend of this functionality
	will log an error and fail with "Unsupported Config" if you actually
	try to assign a USB network adapter to a guest using <interface
	type='hostdev'> - just use a standard <hostdev> entry in that case
	(and also for single-port PCI adapters).

	qemu: refactor hotplug detach of hostdevs
	This refactoring is necessary to support hotplug detach of
	type=hostdev network devices, but needs to be in a separate patch to
	make potential debugging of regressions more practical.

	Rather than the lowest level functions searching for a matching
	device, the search is now done in the toplevel function, and an
	intermediate-level function (qemuDomainDetachThisHostDevice()), which
	expects that the device's entry is already found, is called (this

	virDomainHostdevSubsys struct so that we can define temporary pointers
	to the subsys part.

	conf: give each hostdevdef a parent pointer
	The parent can be any type of device. It defaults to type=none, and a
	NULL pointer. The intent is that if a hostdevdef is contained in the
	def for a higher level device (e.g. virDomainNetDef), hostdev->parent
	will point to the higher level device, and type will be set to that
	type of device. This way, during attach and detach of the device,
	parent can be checked, and appropriate callouts made to do higher
	level device initialization (e.g. setting MAC address).

	Also, although these hostdevs with parents will be added to a domain's
	hostdevs list, they will be treated slightly differently when
	traversing the list, e.g. virDomainHostdefDefFree for a hostdev that
	has a parent doesn't need to be called (and will be a NOP); it will
	simply be removed from the list (since the parent device object is in
	its own type-specific list, and will be freed from there).

	conf: HostdevDef parse/format helper functions
	In an upcoming patch, virDomainNetDef will acquire a
	virDomainHostdevDef, and the <interface> XML will take on some of the
	elements of a <hostdev>. To avoid duplicating the code for parsing and
	formatting the <source> element (which will be nearly identical in
	these two cases), this patch factors those parts out of the
	HostdevDef's parse and format functions, and puts them into separate
	helper functions that are now called by the HostdevDef
	parser/formatter, and will soon be called by the NetDef
	parser/formatter.

	One change in behavior - previously virDomainHostdevDefParseXML() had
	diverged from current common coding practice by logging an error and
	failing if it found any subelements of <hostdev> other than those it
	understood (standard libvirt practice is to ignore/discard unknown
	elements and attributes during parse). The new helper function ignores
	unknown elements, and thus so does the new
	virDomainHostdevDefParseXML.

2012-03-06  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: make hostdev info a separate object
	In order to allow for a virDomainHostdevDef that uses the
	virDomainDeviceInfo of a "higher level" device (such as a
	virDomainNetDef), this patch changes the virDomainDeviceInfo in the
	HostdevDef into a virDomainDeviceInfoPtr. Rather than adding checks
	all over the code to check for a null info, we just guarantee that it
	is always valid. The new function virDomainHostdevDefAlloc() allocates
	a virDomainDeviceInfo and plugs it in, and virDomainHostdevDefFree()
	makes sure it is freed.

	There were 4 places allocating virDomainHostdevDefs, all of them
	parsers of one sort or another, and those have all had their
	VIR_ALLOC(hostdev) changed to virDomainHostdevDefAlloc(). Other than
	that, and the new functions, all the rest of the changes are just
	mechanical removals of "&" or changing "." to "->".

	conf: add device pointer to args of virDomainDeviceInfoIterate callback
	There will be cases where the iterator callback will need to know the
	type of the device whose info is being operated on, and possibly even
	need to use some of the device's config. This patch adds a
	virDomainDeviceDefPtr to the args of every callback, and fills it in
	appropriately as the devices are iterated through.

	qemu: rename virDomainDeviceInfoPtr variables to avoid confusion
	The virDomainDeviceInfoPtrs in qemuCollectPCIAddress and

	virDomainDeviceInfoIterate() callback args) to contain a
	virDomainDeviceDefPtr device.

	This patch renames "dev" to "info" (and "dev[n]" to "info[n]") to
	avoid later confusion.

2012-03-06  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: relocate virDomainDeviceDef and virDomainHostdevDef
	This patch is only code movement + adding some forward definitions of
	typedefs.

	virDomainHostdevDef (not just a pointer to it, but an actual object)
	will be needed in virDomainNetDef and virDomainActualNetDef, so it
	must be relocated earlier in the file.

	Likewise, virDomainDeviceDef will be needed in virDomainHostdevDef, so
	it must be moved up even earlier. This, in turn, creates a forward
	reference problem, but fortunately only with pointers to other device
	types, so their typedefs can be moved up in the file, eliminating the
	problem.

2012-03-06  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: add missing device types to virDomainDevice(Type|Def)
	Not all device types were represented in virDomainDeviceType, so some
	types of devices couldn't be represented in a virDomainDeviceDef
	(which requires a different type of pointer in the union for each
	different kind of device).

	Since serial, parallel, channel, and console devices are all
	virDomainChrDef, and the virDomainDeviceType is never used to produce
	a string from the type (and only used in the other direction
	internally to code, never to produce XML), I only added one "CHR"
	type, which is associated with "virDomainChrDefPtr chr" in the union.

	util: eliminate crash in virNetDevMacVLanCreateWithVPortProfile
	Commit 723d5c (added after the release of 0.9.10) adds a
	NetlinkEventClient for each interface sent to
	virNetDevMacVLanCreateWithVPortProfile. This should only be done if
	the interface actually *has* a virtPortProfile, otherwise the event
	handler would be a NOP. The bigger problem is that part of the setup
	to create the NetlinkEventClient is to do a memcpy of virtPortProfile
	- if it's NULL, this triggers a segv.

	This patch just qualifies the code that adds the client - if
	virtPortProfile is NULL, it's skipped.

	Parallel shutdown has a configurable parameter PARALLEL_SHUTDOWN that

	With an additional new bool added to determine whether or not to

	virNetDevTapCreateInBridgePort had three booleans (well, 2 bools and
	an int used as a bool) in the arg list, which made it increasingly

	into a single flags arg, which not only shortens the arg list, but

	util: centralize tap device MAC address 1st byte "0xFE" modification
	When a tap device for a domain is created and attached to a bridge,
	the first byte of the tap device MAC address is set to 0xFE, while the
	rest is set to match the MAC address that will be presented to the
	guest as its network device MAC address. Setting this high value in
	the tap's MAC address discourages the bridge from using the tap
	device's MAC address as the bridge's own MAC address (Linux bridges
	always take on the lowest numbered MAC address of all attached devices
	as their own).

	In one case within libvirt, a tap device is created and attached to
	the bridge with the intent that its MAC address be taken on by the
	bridge as its own (this is used to assure that the bridge has a fixed
	MAC address to prevent network outages created by the bridge MAC
	address "flapping" as guests are started and stopped). In this case,
	the first byte of the mac address is *not* altered to 0xFE.

	In the current code, callers to virNetDevTapCreateInBridgePort each
	make the MAC address modification themselves before calling, which
	leads to code duplication, and also prevents lower level functions
	from knowing the real MAC address being used by the guest. The problem
	here is that openvswitch bridges must be informed about this MAC
	address, or they will be unable to pass traffic to/from the guest.

	This patch centralizes the location of the MAC address "0xFE fixup"
	into virNetDevTapCreateInBridgePort(), meaning 1) callers of this
	function no longer need the extra strange bit of code, and 2)
	bitNetDevTapCreateBridgeInPort itself now is called with the guest's
	unaltered MAC address, and can pass it on, unmodified, to
	virNetDevOpenvswitchAddPort.

	There is no other behavioral change created by this patch.

	build: use correct type for pid and similar types
	No thanks to 64-bit windows, with 64-bit pid_t, we have to avoid
	constructs like 'int pid'.  Our API in libvirt-qemu cannot be
	changed without breaking ABI; but then again, libvirt-qemu can
	only be used on systems that support UNIX sockets, which rules
	out Windows (even if qemu could be compiled there) - so for all

	we require a different variable name to make it clear that we

	The error checking is still sparse, since libvirt must not use

	qemu: require json for block jobs
	Block job commands are not part of upstream qemu until 1.1; and
	proper support of job completion and cancellation depends on being
	able to receive QMP events, which implies the JSON monitor.
	Additionally, some early versions of block job commands were
	backported to RHEL qemu, but these versions lacked asynchronous
	job cancellation and partial block pull, so there are several
	patches that will still be needed in this area of libvirt code
	to support both flavors of block job commands.

	Due to earlier patches in libvirt, we are guaranteed that all versions
	of qemu that support block job commands already require libvirt to
	use the JSON monitor.  That means that the text version of block jobs
	will not be used, and having to refactor two copies of the block job
	handlers makes no sense.  So instead, we delete the text handlers.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c (qemuMonitorBlockJob): Drop text monitor
	support.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h (qemuMonitorTextBlockJob): Delete.

	tests: Add tests for virtio-scsi and ibmvscsi controllers

2012-02-28  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	qemu: Build command line for the new address format
	For any disk controller model which is not "lsilogic", the command
	line will be like:

	  -drive file=/dev/sda,if=none,id=drive-scsi0-0-3-0,format=raw \
	  -device scsi-disk,bus=scsi0.0,channel=0,scsi-id=3,lun=0,i\
	  drive=drive-scsi0-0-3-0,id=scsi0-0-3-0

	The relationship between the libvirt address attrs and the qdev
	properties are (controller model is not "lsilogic"; strings
	inside <> represent libvirt adress attrs):
	  bus=scsi<controller>.0
	  channel=<bus>
	  scsi-id=<target>
	  lun=<unit>

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.h: (New param "virDomainDefPtr def"
	  for function qemuBuildDriveDevStr; new param "virDomainDefPtr
	  vmdef" for function qemuAssignDeviceDiskAlias. Both for
	  virDomainDiskFindControllerModel's use).

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c:
	  - New param "virDomainDefPtr def" for qemuAssignDeviceDiskAliasCustom.
	    For virDomainDiskFindControllerModel's use, if the disk bus is "scsi"
	    and the controller model is not "lsilogic", "target" is one part of
	    the alias name.
	  - According change on qemuAssignDeviceDiskAlias and qemuBuildDriveDevStr

	* src/qemu/qemu_hotplug.c:
	  - Changes to be consistent with declarations of qemuAssignDeviceDiskAlias
	    qemuBuildDriveDevStr, and qemuBuildControllerDevStr.

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-pseries-vio-user-assigned.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-pseries-vio.args: Update the

	qemu: fix cleanup of bridge during failure of qemuDomainAttachNetDevice
	In qemuDomainAttachNetDevice, the guest's tap interface has only been
	attached to the bridge if iface_connected is true. It's possible for

	attempt to remove the tap interface from the bridge even if it hadn't
	been attached.

	qemu: unescape HMP commands before converting them to json
	QMP commands don't need to be escaped since converting them to json
	also escapes special characters. When a QMP command fails, however,
	libvirt falls back to HMP commands. These fallback functions
	(qemuMonitorText*) do their own escaping, and pass the result directly
	to qemuMonitorHMPCommandWithFd. If the monitor is in json mode, these
	pre-escaped commands will be escaped again when converted to json,
	which can result in the wrong arguments being sent.

	For example, a filename test\file would be sent in json as
	test\\file.

	This prevented attaching an image file with a " or \ in its name in
	qemu 1.0.50, and also broke rbd attachment (which uses backslashes to
	escape some internal arguments.)

	qemu: Add ability to abort existing console while creating new one
	This patch fixes console corruption, that happens if two concurrent
	sessions are opened for a single console on a domain. Result of this
	corruption was that each of the console streams recieved just a part
	of the data written to the pipe so every console rendered unusable.

	New helper function for safe console handling is used to establish the
	console stream connection. This function ensures that no other libvirt
	client is using the console (with the ability to disconnect consoles of
	libvirt clients) and that no UUCP style lockfile is placed on the PTY
	device.

	* src/qemu/qemu_domain.h
	        - add data structure to domain's private data dealing with
	          console connections
	* src/qemu/qemu_domain.c:
	        - allocate/free domain's console data structure
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c
	        - use the new helper function for console handling

2012-02-27  Peter Krempa  <pkrempa@redhat.com>

	util: Add helpers for safe domain console operations
	This patch adds a set of functions used in creating console streams for
	domains using PTYs and ensures mutually exclusive access to the PTYs.

	If mutually exclusive access is not used, two clients may open the same
	console, which results in corruption on both clients as both of them
	race to read data from the PTY.

	Two approaches are used to ensure this:
	1) Internal data structure holding open PTYs.
	        This is used internally and enables the user to forcibly
	        terminate another console connection eg. when somebody leaves
	        the console open on another host.

	2) UUCP style lock files:
	        This uses UUCP lock files according to the  FHS
	        ( http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#VARLOCKLOCKFILES )
	        to check if other programs (like minicom) are not using the pty
	        device of the console.

	        This feature is disabled by default and may be enabled using
	        configure parameter
	        --with-console-lock-files=/path/to/lock/file/directory
	        or --with-console-lock-files=auto (which tries to infer the
	        location from OS used (currently only linux).

	        On usual linux systems, normal users may not write to the
	        /var/lock directory containing the locks. This poses problems
	        while in session mode. If the current user has no access to the
	        lockfile directory, check for presence of the file is still
	        done, but no lock file is created. This does NOT result in an
	        error.

	fdstream: Add internal callback on stream close
	This patch adds another callback to a FDstream object. The original
	callback is used by the daemon stream driver to handle events.

	This callback is called if and only if the stream is about to be closed.
	This might be used to handle cleanup steps after a fdstream exits. This
	will be used later on in ensuring mutually exclusive access to consoles.

	* src/fdstream.c:
	        - emit the callback, when stream is being closed
	        - add data structures needed to handle the callback
	        - add function to register callback
	* src/fdstream.h:
	        - define function prototypes for the callback

2012-02-27  Peter Krempa  <pkrempa@redhat.com>

	fdstream: Emit stream abort callback even if poll() doesnt.
	This patch causes the fdstream driver to call the stream event callback
	if virStreamAbort() is called on a stream using this driver.

	A remote handler for a stream can only detect changes via stream events,
	so this event callback is necessary in order to enable a daemon to abort
	a stream in such a way that the client will see the change.

	* src/fdstream.c:
	        - modify close function to call stream event callback

2012-02-27  Peter Krempa  <pkrempa@redhat.com>

	virsh: add support for VIR_DOMAIN_CONSOLE_* flags
	This patch adds support for the newly introduced
	VIR_DOMAIN_CONSOLE_FORCE and VIR_DOMAIN_CONSOLE_SAFE flags. The console
	command now has an optional parameter --force that specifies that the
	user wants to forcibly interrupt an ongoing console session and create
	a new one. Flag --safe requests that the console should be opened only
	if the hypervisor driver supports safe console handling.

	The behaviour to this point was that the daemon opened two streams to
	the console, that competed for data from the pipe, and the result was
	that both of the consoles ended up scrambled.

	This patch doesn't modify operation of other commands dealing with
	console connections (start, create) as those open connections to newly
	started domains making it virtually impossible for another client to race
	for the console and steal it.

	* tools/console.c:
	        - add support for flag passthrough
	* tools/console.h:
	        - modify function prototypes to match impl.
	* tools/virsh.c:
	        - add flag --force for the console command

2012-02-27  Peter Krempa  <pkrempa@redhat.com>

	Add flags for virDomainOpenConsole
	This patch adds a set of flags to be used with the virDomainOpenConsole
	API call to specify if the user wishes to interrupt an existing console
	session or just to try open a new one.

	VIR_DOMAIN_CONSOLE_SAFE - specifies that the console connection should
	                          be opened only if the hypervisor supports
	                          mutually exclusive access to console devices

	VIR_DOMAIN_CONSOLE_FORCE - specifies that the caller wishes to interrupt
	                           existing session and force a creation of a
	                           new one.

	Fixed URI parsing
	Function xmlParseURI does not remove square brackets around IPv6
	address when parsing. One of the solutions is making wrappers around
	functions working with xmlURI*. This assures that uri->server will be
	always properly assigned and it doesn't have to be changed when used
	on some new place in the code.
	For this purpose, functions virParseURI and virSaveURI were
	added. These function are wrappers around xmlParseURI and xmlSaveUri
	respectively.
	Also there is one new syntax check function to prohibit these functions
	anywhere else.

	File changes:
	 - src/util/viruri.h        -- declaration
	 - src/util/viruri.c        -- definition
	 - src/libvirt_private.syms -- symbol export

	Error out when using SPICE TLS with spice_tls=0
	It's possible to disable SPICE TLS in qemu.conf. When this happens,
	libvirt ignores any SPICE TLS port or x509 directory that may have
	been set when it builds the qemu command line to use. However, it's
	not ignoring the secure channels that may have been set and adds
	tls-channel arguments to qemu command line.
	Current qemu versions don't report an error when this happens, and try to use
	TLS for the specified channels.

	Before this patch

	<domain type='kvm'>
	  <name>auto-tls-port</name>
	  <memory>65536</memory>
	  <os>
	    <type arch='x86_64' machine='pc'>hvm</type>
	  </os>
	  <devices>
	    <graphics type='spice' port='5900' tlsPort='-1' autoport='yes' listen='0' ke
	      <listen type='address' address='0'/>
	      <channel name='main' mode='secure'/>
	      <channel name='inputs' mode='secure'/>
	    </graphics>
	  </devices>
	</domain>

	generates

	-spice port=5900,addr=0,disable-ticketing,tls-channel=main,tls-channel=inputs

	and starts QEMU.

	After this patch, an error is reported if a TLS port is set in the XML
	or if secure channels are specified but TLS is disabled in qemu.conf.
	This is the behaviour the oVirt people (where I spotted this issue) said
	they would expect.

	network: support Open vSwitch
	This patch allows libvirt to add interfaces to already
	existing Open vSwitch bridges. The following syntax in
	domain XML file can be used:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <mac address='52:54:00:d0:3f:f2'/>
	      <source bridge='ovsbr'/>
	      <virtualport type='openvswitch'>
	        <parameters interfaceid='921a80cd-e6de-5a2e-db9c-ab27f15a6e1d'/>
	      </virtualport>
	      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00'
	                          slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>
	    </interface>

	or if libvirt should auto-generate the interfaceid use
	following syntax:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <mac address='52:54:00:d0:3f:f2'/>
	      <source bridge='ovsbr'/>
	      <virtualport type='openvswitch'>
	      </virtualport>
	      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00'
	                          slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>
	    </interface>

	It is also possible to pass an optional profileid. To do that
	use following syntax:

	   <interface type='bridge'>
	     <source bridge='ovsbr'/>
	     <mac address='00:55:1a:65:a2:8d'/>
	     <virtualport type='openvswitch'>
	       <parameters interfaceid='921a80cd-e6de-5a2e-db9c-ab27f15a6e1d'
	                   profileid='test-profile'/>
	     </virtualport>
	   </interface>

	To create Open vSwitch bridge install Open vSwitch and
	run the following command:

	    ovs-vsctl add-br ovsbr

	qemu: increase the timeout before sending SIGKILL to qemu process
	The current default method of terminating the qemu process is to send
	a SIGTERM, wait for up to 1.6 seconds for it to cleanly shutdown, then
	send a SIGKILL and wait for up to 1.4 seconds more for the process to
	terminate. This is problematic because occasionally 1.6 seconds is not
	long enough for the qemu process to flush its disk buffers, so the
	guest's disk ends up in an inconsistent state.

	Since this only occasionally happens when the timeout prior to SIGKILL
	is 1.6 seconds, this patch increases that timeout to 10 seconds. At
	the very least, this should reduce the occurrence from "occasionally"
	to "extremely rarely". (Once SIGKILL is sent, it waits another 5
	seconds for the process to die before returning).

	Note that in the cases where it takes less than this for qemu to
	shutdown cleanly, libvirt will *not* wait for any longer than it would
	without this patch - qemuProcessKill polls the process and returns as
	soon as it is gone.

	qemu: drop driver lock while trying to terminate qemu process
	This patch is based on an earlier patch by Eric Blake which was never
	committed:

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2011-November/msg00243.html

	Aside from rebasing, this patch only drops the driver lock once (prior
	to the first time the function sleeps), then leaves it dropped until
	it returns (Eric's patch would drop and re-acquire the lock around
	each call to sleep).

	At the time Eric sent his patch, the response (from Dan Berrange) was
	that, while it wasn't a good thing to be holding the driver lock while
	sleeping, we really need to rethink locking wrt the driver object,
	switching to a finer-grained approach that locks individual items
	within the driver object separately to allow for greater concurrency.

	This is a good plan, and at the time it made sense to not apply the
	patch because there was no known bug related to the driver lock being
	held in this function.

	However, we now know that the length of the wait in qemuProcessKill is
	sometimes too short to allow the qemu process to fully flush its disk
	cache before SIGKILL is sent, so we need to lengthen the timeout (in
	order to improve the situation with management applications until they
	can be updated to use the new VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEFUL flag added
	in commit 72f8a7f19753506ed957b78ad800c0f3892c9304). But, if we
	lengthen the timeout, we also lengthen the amount of time that all
	other threads in libvirtd are essentially blocked from doing anything
	(since just about everything needs to acquire the driver lock, if only
	for long enough to get a pointer to a domain).

	The solution is to modify qemuProcessKill to drop the driver lock
	while sleeping, as proposed in Eric's patch. Then we can increase the
	timeout with a clear conscience, and thus at least lower the chances
	that someone running with existing management software will suffer the
	consequence's of qemu's disk cache not being flushed.

	In the meantime, we still should work on Dan's proposal to make
	locking within the driver object more fine grained.

	(NB: although I couldn't find any instance where qemuProcessKill() was
	called with no jobs active for the domain (or some other guarantee
	that the current thread had at least one refcount on the domain
	object), this patch still follows Eric's method of temporarily adding
	a ref prior to unlocking the domain object, because I couldn't
	convince myself 100% that this was the case.)

	Install API XML desc to a standard location
	Language bindings may well want to use the libvirt-api.xml and
	libvirt-qemu-api.xml files to either auto-generate themselves,
	or sanity check the manually written bindings for completeness.
	Currently these XML files are not installed as standard, merely
	ending up as a %doc file in the RPM.

	This changes them to be installed into $prefix/share/libvirt/apis/
	The *-refs.xml files are not installed, since those are only
	useful during generation of the online API doc files.

	The pkg-config file is enhanced so that you can query the install
	location of the API files. eg

	  # pkg-config --variable=libvirt_qemu_api libvirt
	  /home/berrange/builder/i686-pc-mingw32/sys-root/mingw/share/libvirt/libvirt-qemu-api.xml

	The auto-generated WWN comply with the new addressing schema of WWN:

	<quote>
	the first nibble is either hex 5 or 6 followed by a 3-byte vendor

	</quote>

	We choose hex 5 for the first nibble. And for the 3-bytes vendor ID,
	we uses the OUI according to underlying hypervisor type, (invoking
	virConnectGetType to get the virt type). e.g. If virConnectGetType
	returns "QEMU", we use Qumranet's OUI (00:1A:4A), if returns
	ESX|VMWARE, we use VMWARE's OUI (00:05:69). Currently it only

	security: Driver 'none' cannot create confined guests
	In case the caller specifies that confined guests are required but the

	Since security driver 'none' cannot create confined guests, we override

	seclabel: Do not output relabel attribute for type 'none'
	Security label type 'none' requires relabel to be set to 'no' so there's

	relabel would be 'yes' in case there is no <seclabel> element in domain

	qemu: Always use iohelper for dumping domain core

	On systems with dmidecode version 2.10 or older,
	 dmidecode displays processor information, followed by BIOS, system and
	 memory-DIMM details.
	 Calls to virSysinfoParseBIOS(), virSysinfoParseSystem() would update
	 the buffer pointer 'base', so the processor information would be lost
	 before virSysinfoParseProcessor() was called. Sysinfo would therefore
	 not be able to display processor details -- It only described <bios>,
	 <system> and <memory_device> details.
	 This patch attempts to insulate sysinfo from ordering of dmidecode
	 output.

	Before the fix:
	---------------
	virsh # sysinfo
	<sysinfo type='smbios'>
	  <bios>
	    ....
	  </bios>
	  <system>
	    ....
	  </system>
	  <memory_device>
	    ....
	  </memory_device>

	After the fix:
	-------------
	virsh # sysinfo
	<sysinfo type='smbios'>
	  <bios>
	    ....
	  </bios>

	storage: Don't unsparsify images when cloning
	Input to the volume cloning code is a source volume and an XML
	descriptor for the new volume. It is possible for the new volume
	to have a greater size than source volume, at which point libvirt
	will just stick 0s on the end of the new image (for raw format
	anyways).

	Unfortunately a logic error messed up our tracking of the of the
	excess amount that needed to be written: end result is that sparse
	clones were made very much non-sparse, and cloning regular disk
	images could end up excessively sized (though data unaltered).

	Drop the 'remain' variable entriely here since it's redundant, and
	track actual allocation directly against the desired 'total'.

	build: don't require avahi during install
	See: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=785269

	The specfile requires avahi during install if libvirt was built with
	avahi support, but there are many situations where it is undesirable
	to install avahi due to security concerns. This patch requires only
	the avahi-libs package, which is needed by libvirt to call the
	function that tries to attach to the avahi daemon, but will instead
	silently fail because the avahi-daemon is in the main avahi package,
	and that package isn't installed.

	Allow polkit auth for VNC and SSH users
	If you are sitting in front of a physical machine and logged in as
	a regular user, you can connect to the system libvirtd instance
	by providing a root password to policykit. This is how most
	virt-manager users talk to libvirt.

	However, if you are launching virt-manager over ssh -X, or over
	VNC started from say /etc/sysconfig/vncservers, our policykit policy
	rejects the user outright, providing no option to provide the root
	password. This is confusing to users and doesn't seem to serve much
	point.

	Change the policy to allow inactive (VNC) and non-local (SSH, VNC)
	to provide root credentials for accessing system libvirtd. We use
	auth_admin rather than auth_admin_keep so that credentials aren't
	cached at all, and every subsequent reconnection to libvirt requires
	auth.

	Fixes: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=625115

	xen-xm: fix data loss in domain edit
	On CentOS5:
	If "virsh edit $DOM" is used and an error happens (for example changing
	any live cycle action to a non-existing value), libvirt forgets that
	$DOM exists, since it is already removed from the internal hash tables,
	which are used for domain lookup.
	In once case (unreproducible) even the persistent configuration
	/etc/xen/$DOM was deleted.

	Instead of using the compound function xenXMConfigSaveFile() explicitly
	use xenFomatXM() and virConfWriteFile() to distinguish between a failure
	in converting the libvirt definition to the xen-xm format and a problem
	when writing the file.

	qemu: eliminate "Ignoring open failure" when using root-squash NFS
	This eliminates the warning message reported in:

	 https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=624447

	It was caused by a failure to open an image file that is not
	accessible by root (the uid libvirtd is running as) because it's on a
	root-squash NFS share, owned by a different user, with permissions of
	660 (or maybe 600).

	The solution is to use virFileOpenAs() rather than open(). The
	codepath that generates the error is during qemuSetupDiskCGroup(), but
	the actual open() is in a lower-level generic function called from
	many places (virDomainDiskDefForeachPath), so some other pieces of the
	code were touched just to add dummy (or possibly useful) uid and gid
	arguments.

	Eliminating this warning message has the nice side effect that the
	requested operation may even succeed (which in this case isn't
	necessary, but shouldn't hurt anything either).

2012-02-04  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	util: refactor virFileOpenAs
	virFileOpenAs previously would only try opening a file as the current
	user, or as a different user, but wouldn't try both methods in a
	single call. This made it cumbersome to use as a replacement for
	open(2). Additionally, it had a lot of historical baggage that led to
	it being difficult to understand.

	This patch refactors virFileOpenAs in the following ways:

	* reorganize the code so that everything dealing with both the parent
	  and child sides of the "fork+setuid+setgid+open" method are in a
	  separate function. This makes the public function easier to understand.

	* Allow a single call to virFileOpenAs() to first attempt the open as
	  the current user, and if that fails to automatically re-try after
	  doing fork+setuid (if deemed appropriate, i.e. errno indicates it
	  would now be successful, and the file is on a networkFS). This makes
	  it possible (in many, but possibly not all, cases) to drop-in
	  virFileOpenAs() as a replacement for open(2).

	  (NB: currently qemuOpenFile() calls virFileOpenAs() twice, once
	  without forking, then again with forking. That unfortunately can't
	  be changed without at least some discussion of the ramifications,
	  because the requested file permissions are different in each case,
	  which is something that a single call to virFileOpenAs() can't deal
	  with.)

	* Add a flag so that any fchown() of the file to a different uid:gid
	  is explicitly requested when the function is called, rather than it
	  being implied by the presence of the O_CREAT flag. This just makes
	  for less subtle surprises to consumers. (Commit
	  b1643dc15c5de886fefe56ad18608d65f1325a2c added the check for O_CREAT
	  before forcing ownership. This patch just makes that restriction
	  more explicit.)

	* If either the uid or gid is specified as "-1", virFileOpenAs will
	  interpret this to mean "the current [gu]id".

	All current consumers of virFileOpenAs should retain their present
	behavior (after a few minor changes to their setup code and
	arguments).

	virsh: add --graceful switch to destroy command
	This allows virsh to use the new VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEUL flag for
	virDomainDestroyFlags.

2012-02-04  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: new GRACEFUL flag for virDomainDestroy w/ QEMU support
	When libvirt's virDomainDestroy API is shutting down the qemu process,
	it first sends SIGTERM, then waits for 1.6 seconds and, if it sees the
	process still there, sends a SIGKILL.

	There have been reports that this behavior can lead to data loss
	because the guest running in qemu doesn't have time to flush its disk
	cache buffers before it's unceremoniously whacked.

	This patch maintains that default behavior, but provides a new flag
	VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEFUL to alter the behavior. If this flag is set
	in the call to virDomainDestroyFlags, SIGKILL will never be sent to
	the qemu process; instead, if the timeout is reached and the qemu
	process still exists, virDomainDestroy will return an error.

	Once this patch is in, the recommended method for applications to call
	virDomainDestroyFlags will be with VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEFUL
	included. If that fails, then the application can decide if and when
	to call virDomainDestroyFlags again without
	VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEFUL (to force the issue with SIGKILL).

	(Note that this does not address the issue of existing applications
	that have not yet been modified to use VIR_DOMAIN_DESTROY_GRACEFUL.
	That is a separate patch.)

	Fixed connection definition for non-SELinux builds
	This patch fixes the access of variable "con" in two files where the
	variable was declared only on SELinux builds and thus the build failed
	without SELinux. It's a rather nasty fix but helps fix the build
	quickly and without any major changes to the code.

	Added RSS reporting
	Added RSS information gathering into qemuMemoryStats into qemu driver
	and the reporting into virsh dommemstat.

	Added RSS information gathering into qemudGetProcessInfo
	One more parameter added into the function parsing /proc/<pid>/stat
	and the call of the function is fixed as well.

	Add support for sVirt in the LXC driver
	For the sake of backwards compat, LXC guests are *not*

	by giving suitable XML configs

	Add two new security label types
	Curently security labels can be of type 'dynamic' or 'static'.
	If no security label is given, then 'dynamic' is assumed. The
	current code takes advantage of this default, and avoids even
	saving <seclabel> elements with type='dynamic' to disk. This
	means if you temporarily change security driver, the guests
	can all still start.

	With the introduction of sVirt to LXC though, there needs to be
	a new default of 'none' to allow unconfined LXC containers.

	This patch introduces two new security label types

	 - default:  the host configuration decides whether to run the
	             guest with type 'none' or 'dynamic' at guest start
	 - none:     the guest will run unconfined by security policy

	The 'none' label type will obviously be undesirable for some
	deployments, so a new qemu.conf option allows a host admin to
	mandate confined guests. It is also possible to turn off default
	confinement

	  security_default_confined = 1|0  (default == 1)
	  security_require_confined = 1|0  (default == 0)

	These two commits changed the sec label parsing code so that

	tests: dynamically replace dnsmasq path
	The path to the dnsmasq binary can be configured while in the test data
	the path is hard-coded to /usr/bin/. This break the test suite if a the

	Replace the hard coded path in the test data by a token, which is

	block rebase: initial qemu implementation
	This is a trivial implementation, which works with the current

	block rebase: add new API virDomainBlockRebase
	Qemu is adding the ability to do a partial rebase.  That is, given:

	base <- intermediate <- current

	virDomainBlockPull will produce:

	current

	but qemu now has the ability to leave base in the chain, to produce:

	base <- current

	Note that current qemu can only do a forward merge, and only with
	the current image as the destination, which is fully described by
	this API without flags.  But in the future, it may be possible to
	enhance this API for additional scenarios by using flags:

	Merging the current image back into a previous image (that is,
	undoing a live snapshot), could be done by passing base as the
	destination and flags with a bit requesting a backward merge.

	Merging any other part of the image chain, whether forwards (the
	backing image contents are pulled into the newer file) or backwards
	(the deltas recorded in the newer file are merged back into the
	backing file), could also be done by passing a new flag that says
	that base should be treated as an XML snippet rather than an
	absolute path name, where the XML could then supply the additional
	instructions of which part of the image chain is being merged into
	any other part.

	declaration.

2012-02-01  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	resize: slightly alter signature
	Our existing virDomainBlockResize takes an unsigned long long
	argument; if that command is later taught a DELTA and SHRINK flag,
	we cannot change its type without breaking API (but at least such
	a change would be ABI compatible).  Meanwhile, the only time a
	negative size makes sense is if both DELTA and SHRINK are used
	together, but if we keep the argument unsigned, applications can
	pass the positive delta amount by which they would like to shrink
	the system, and have the flags imply the negative value.  So,
	since this API has not yet been released, and in the interest of
	consistency with existing API, we swap virStorageVolResize to
	always pass an unsigned value.

	qemu: add "romfile" support to specify device boot ROM
	This patch addresses: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=781562

	Along with the "rombar" option that controls whether or not a boot rom
	is made visible to the guest, qemu also has a "romfile" option that
	allows specifying a binary file to present as the ROM BIOS of any
	emulated or passthrough PCI device. This patch adds support for
	specifying romfile to both passthrough PCI devices, and emulated
	network devices that attach to the guest's PCI bus (just about
	everything other than ne2k_isa).

	One example of the usefulness of this option is described in the
	bugzilla report: 82576 sriov network adapters don't provide a ROM BIOS
	for the cards virtual functions (VF), but an image of such a ROM is
	available, and with this ROM visible to the guest, it can PXE boot.

	In libvirt's xml, the new option is configured like this:

	   <hostdev>
	     ...
	     <rom file='/etc/fake/boot.bin'/>
	     ...
	   </hostdev

	(similarly for <interface>).

2012-01-31  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: (and conf) support rombar for network devices
	When support for the rombar option was added, it was only added for
	PCI passthrough devices, configured with <hostdev>. The same option is
	available for any network device that is attached to the guest's PCI
	bus. This patch allows setting rombar for any PCI network device type.

	After adding cases to test this to qemuxml2argv-hostdev-pci-rombar.*,
	I decided to rename those files (to qemuxml2argv-pci-rom.*) to more
	accurately reflect the additional tests, and also noticed that up to
	now we've only been performing a domainschematest for that case, so I
	added the "pci-rom" test to both qemuxml2argv and qemuxml2xml (and in
	the process found some bugs whose fixes I squashed into previous
	commits of this series).

2012-01-31  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: relocate rombar and boot order parse/format
	Since these two items are now in the virDomainDeviceInfo struct, it
	makes sense to parse/format them in the functions written to
	parse/format that structure. Not all types of devices allow them, so
	two internal flags are added to indicate when it is appropriate to do
	so.

	I was lucky - only one test case needed to be re-ordered!

2012-01-31  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: put all guest-related HostdevDef data in one object
	To help consolidate the commonality between virDomainHostdevDef and
	virDomainNetDef into as few members as possible (and because I
	think it makes sense), this patch moves the rombar and bootIndex
	members into the "info" member that is common to both (and to all the
	other structs that use them).

	It's a bit problematic that this gives rombar and bootIndex to many
	device types that don't use them, but this is already the case for the
	master and mastertype members of virDomainDeviceInfo, and is properly
	commented as such in the definition.

	Note that this opens the door to supporting rombar for other devices
	that are attached to the guest PCI bus - virtio-blk-pci,
	virtio-net-pci, various other network adapters - which which have that
	capability in qemu, but previously had no support in libvirt.

	qemu: parse and create -cpu ...,-kvmclock
	QEMU supports a bunch of CPUID features that are tied to the kvm CPUID
	nodes rather than the processor's.  They are "kvmclock",
	"kvm_nopiodelay", "kvm_mmu", "kvm_asyncpf".  These are not known to
	libvirt and their CPUID leaf might move if (for example) the Hyper-V
	extensions are enabled. Hence their handling would anyway require some
	special-casing.

	However, among these the most useful is kvmclock; an additional
	"property" of this feature is that a <timer> element is a better model
	than a CPUID feature.  Although, creating part of the -cpu command-line
	from something other than the <cpu> XML element introduces some
	ugliness.

	qemu: do not create useless <cpu> element
	Avoid creating an empty <cpu> element when the QEMU command-line simply

	Replace hashing algorithm with murmurhash
	Recent discussions have illustrated the potential for DOS attacks
	with the hash table implementations used by most languages and
	libraries.

	   https://lwn.net/Articles/474912/

	libvirt has an internal hash table impl, and uses hash tables for
	a variety of purposes. The hash key generation code is pretty
	simple and thus not strongly collision resistant.

	This patch replaces the current libvirt hash key generator with
	the (public domain) Murmurhash3 code. In addition every hash
	table now gets a random seed value which is used to perturb the
	hashing code. This should make it impossible to mount any
	practical attack against libvirt hashing code.

	* bootstrap.conf: Import bitrotate module
	* src/Makefile.am: Add virhashcode.[ch]
	* src/util/util.c: Make virRandom() return a fixed 32 bit
	  integer value.
	* src/util/hash.c, src/util/hash.h, src/util/cgroup.c: Replace
	  hash code generation with a call to virHashCodeGen()
	* src/util/virhashcode.h, src/util/virhashcode.c: Add a new
	  virHashCodeGen() API using the Murmurhash3 algorithm.

2012-01-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rename  hash.h and hash.c to virhash.h and virhash.c
	In preparation for the patch to include Murmurhash3, which
	introduces a virhashcode.h and virhashcode.c files, rename
	the existing hash.h and hash.c to virhash.h and virhash.c
	respectively.

	Convert various virHash functions to use size_t / uint32
	In preparation for conversion over to use the Murmurhash3
	algorithm, convert various virHash APIs to use size_t or
	uint32 for their return values/parameters, instead of the
	variable size 'unsigned long' or 'int' types

	storage: Fix any VolLookupByPath if we have an empty logical pool
	On F16 at least, empty volume groups don't have a directory under /dev.
	The directory only appears once a logical volume is created.

	This tickles some behavior in BackendStablePath which ends with
	libvirt sleeping for 5 seconds while waiting for the directory to appear.
	This causes all sorts of problems for the virStorageVolLookupByPath API
	which virtinst uses, even if trying to resolve a path that is independent
	of the logical pool.

	In reality we don't even need to do that checking since logical pools
	always have a stable target path. Short circuit the polling in that
	case.

	Fixes bug 782261

	virCommandProcessIO(): make poll() usage more robust
	POLLIN and POLLHUP are not mutually exclusive. Currently the following
	seems possible: the child writes 3K to its stdout or stderr pipe, and
	immediately closes it. We get POLLIN|POLLHUP (I'm not sure that's possible
	on Linux, but SUSv4 seems to allow it). We read 1K and throw away the
	rest.

	When poll() returns and we're about to check the /revents/ member in a
	given array element, let's map all the revents bits to two (independent)
	ideas: "let's attempt to read()", and "let's attempt to write()". This
	should cover all errors, EOFs, and normal conditions; the read()/write()
	call should report any pending error.

	Under this approach, both POLLHUP and POLLERR are mapped to "needs read()"
	if we're otherwise prepared for POLLIN. POLLERR also maps to "needs
	write()" if we're otherwise prepared for POLLOUT. The rest of the mappings
	(POLLPRI etc.) would be easy, but probably useless for pipes.

	Additionally, SUSv4 doesn't appear to forbid POLLIN|POLLERR (or
	POLLOUT|POLLERR) set simultaneously. One could argue that the read() or
	write() call would return without blocking in these cases (with an error),
	so POLLIN / POLLOUT would be justified beside POLLERR.

	The code now penalizes POLLIN|POLLERR differently from plain POLLERR. The
	former (ie. read() returning -1) is terminal and we jump to cleanup, while
	plain POLLERR masks only the affected file descriptor for the future.
	Let's unify those.

	Added capability checking for block <iotune> setting.
	There was missing capability for blkiotune and thus specifying these
	settings caused libvirt to run qemu with invalid parameters and then
	reporting qemu error instead of the standard libvirt one. The support
	for blkiotune setting was added in upstream qemu repo under commit
	0563e191516289c9d2f282a8c50f2eecef2fa773.

	Fix startup of LXC containers with filesystems containing symlinks
	Given an LXC guest with a root filesystem path of

	  /export/lxc/roots/helloworld/root

	During startup, we will pivot the root filesystem to end up
	at

	  /.oldroot/export/lxc/roots/helloworld/root

	We then try to open

	  /.oldroot/export/lxc/roots/helloworld/root/dev/pts

	Now consider if '/export/lxc' is an absolute symlink pointing
	to '/media/lxc'. The kernel will try to open

	  /media/lxc/roots/helloworld/root/dev/pts

	whereas it should be trying to open

	  /.oldroot//media/lxc/roots/helloworld/root/dev/pts

	To deal with the fact that the root filesystem can be moved,
	we need to resolve symlinks in *any* part of the filesystem
	source path.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms, src/util/util.c,
	  src/util/util.h: Add virFileResolveAllLinks to resolve

	qemu: Prohibit reattaching node device if it is in use
	It doesn't make sense to reattach a device to host while it's
	still in use, e.g, by a domain.

2012-01-18  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	qemu: Introduce inactive PCI device list
	pciTrySecondaryBusReset checks if there is active device on the
	same bus, however, qemu driver doesn't maintain an effective
	list for the inactive devices, and it passes meaningless argument
	for parameter "inactiveDevs". e.g. (qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevices)

	if (!(pcidevs = qemuGetPciHostDeviceList(hostdevs, nhostdevs)))
	    return -1;

	..skipped...

	if (pciResetDevice(dev, driver->activePciHostdevs, pcidevs) < 0)
	    goto reattachdevs;

	NB, the "pcidevs" used above are extracted from domain def, and
	thus one won't be able to attach a device of which bus has other
	device even detached from host (nodedev-detach). To see more
	details of the problem:

	RHBZ: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=773667

	This patch is to resolve the problem by introducing an inactive
	PCI device list (just like qemu_driver->activePciHostdevs), and
	the whole logic is:

	  * Add the device to inactive list during nodedev-dettach
	  * Remove the device from inactive list during nodedev-reattach
	  * Remove the device from inactive list during attach-device
	    (for non-managed device)
	  * Add the device to inactive list after detach-device, only
	    if the device is not managed

	With the above, we have a sufficient inactive PCI device list, and thus
	we can use it for pciResetDevice. e.g.(qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevices)

	if (pciResetDevice(dev, driver->activePciHostdevs,
	                   driver->inactivePciHostdevs) < 0)
	    goto reattachdevs;

	Add new attribute wrpolicy to <driver> element
	This introduces new attribute wrpolicy with only supported
	value as immediate. This will be an optional
	attribute with no defaults. This helps specify whether
	to skip the host page cache.

	When wrpolicy is specified, meaning when wrpolicy=immediate
	a writeback is explicitly initiated for the dirty pages in
	the host page cache as part of the guest file write operation.

	Usage:
	<filesystem type='mount' accessmode='passthrough'>
	  <driver type='path' wrpolicy='immediate'/>
	  <source dir='/export/to/guest'/>
	  <target dir='mount_tag'/>
	</filesystem>

	Currently this only works with type='mount' for the QEMU/KVM driver.

	qemu: Don't break domain with 0:0:2.0 assigned to anything but VGA
	In the past we didn't reserve 0:0:2.0 PCI address if there was no video
	device assigned to a domain, which made it impossible to add a video
	device later on. So we fixed it (commit v0.9.0-37-g7b2cac1) by always
	reserving that address. However, that breaks existing domains without
	video devices that already have another device assigned to the
	problematic address.

	This patch reserves address 0:0:2.0 only in case it was not explicitly
	assigned to another device, which means libvirt will try to keep this
	address free and will not automatically assign it new devices. But
	existing domains for which older libvirt already assigned the address to
	a non-video device will keep working as they used to work before 0.9.1.
	Moreover, users who want to create a domain without a video device and
	use its address for another device may do so by explicitly configuring
	the PCI address in domain XML.

	qemu: Add support for host CPU modes
	This adds support for host-model and host-passthrough CPU modes to qemu
	driver. The host-passthrough mode is mapped to -cpu host.

2012-01-17  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Taint domains configured with cpu mode=host-passthrough
	There are several reasons for doing this:

	- the CPU specification is out of libvirt's control so we cannot
	  guarantee stable guest ABI
	- not every feature of a CPU may actually work as expected when
	  advertised directly to a guest
	- migration between two machines with exactly the same CPU may work but
	  no guarantees can be made
	- this mode is not supported and its use is at one's own risk

2012-01-17  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	cpu: Update guest CPU in host-* mode
	VIR_DOMAIN_XML_UPDATE_CPU flag for virDomainGetXMLDesc may be used to
	get updated custom mode guest CPU definition in case it depends on host
	CPU. This patch implements the same behavior for host-model and
	host-passthrough CPU modes.

2012-01-17  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Add support for cpu mode attribute
	The mode can be either of "custom" (default), "host-model",
	"host-passthrough". The semantics of each mode is described in the
	following examples:

	- guest CPU is a default model with specified topology:
	    <cpu>
	      <topology sockets='1' cores='2' threads='1'/>
	    </cpu>

	- guest CPU matches selected model:
	    <cpu mode='custom' match='exact'>
	      <model>core2duo</model>
	    </cpu>

	- guest CPU should be a copy of host CPU as advertised by capabilities
	  XML (this is a short cut for manually copying host CPU specification
	  from capabilities to domain XML):
	    <cpu mode='host-model'/>

	  In case a hypervisor does not support the exact host model, libvirt
	  automatically falls back to a closest supported CPU model and
	  removes/adds features to match host. This behavior can be disabled by
	    <cpu mode='host-model'>
	      <model fallback='forbid'/>
	    </cpu>

	- the same as previous returned by virDomainGetXMLDesc with
	  VIR_DOMAIN_XML_UPDATE_CPU flag:
	    <cpu mode='host-model' match='exact'>
	      <model fallback='allow'>Penryn</model>       --+
	      <vendor>Intel</vendor>                         |
	      <topology sockets='2' cores='4' threads='1'/>  + copied from
	      <feature policy='require' name='dca'/>         | capabilities XML
	      <feature policy='require' name='xtpr'/>        |
	      ...                                          --+
	    </cpu>

	- guest CPU should be exactly the same as host CPU even in the aspects
	  libvirt doesn't model (such domain cannot be migrated unless both
	  hosts contain exactly the same CPUs):
	    <cpu mode='host-passthrough'/>

	- the same as previous returned by virDomainGetXMLDesc with
	  VIR_DOMAIN_XML_UPDATE_CPU flag:
	    <cpu mode='host-passthrough' match='minimal'>
	      <model>Penryn</model>                        --+ copied from caps
	      <vendor>Intel</vendor>                         | XML but doesn't
	      <topology sockets='2' cores='4' threads='1'/>  | describe all
	      <feature policy='require' name='dca'/>         | aspects of the
	      <feature policy='require' name='xtpr'/>        | actual guest CPU
	      ...                                          --+
	    </cpu>

2012-01-17  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	cpu: Optionally forbid fallback CPU models
	In case a hypervisor doesn't support the exact CPU model requested by a
	domain XML, we automatically fallback to a closest CPU model the
	hypervisor supports (and make sure we add/remove any additional features
	if needed). This patch adds 'fallback' attribute to model element, which
	can be used to disable this automatic fallback.

	    x86-host+guest,models,qemu64-result.xml

	Clarify semantics of virDomainMigrate{,ToURI}2
	Commit 5d784bd6d7b19314b0908aec6b46bfe377aeba42 was a nice attempt to
	clarify the semantics by requiring domain name from dxml to either match
	original name or dname. However, setting dxml domain name to dname
	doesn't really work since destination host needs to know the original
	domain name to be able to use it in migration cookies. This patch
	requires domain name in dxml to match the original domain name. The
	change should be safe and backward compatible since migration would fail
	just a bit later in the process.

	tests: Add qemuxml2argv tests for PPC64 pseries machine
	Add four tests of the XML -> argv handling for the PPC64 pseries machine.

	The first is just a basic test of a bare bones machine.

	The three others test various aspects of the spapr-vio address handling.

	It seems that currently we can't include network devices, doing so leads
	to a segfault because the network driverState is not initialised. Working
	around that leads us to the problem that the 'default' network doesn't
	exist. So for now just leave network devices out.

2012-01-14  Michael Ellerman  <michael@ellerman.id.au>

	tests: Teach qemuxml2argvtest about spapr-vio addresses
	We can't call qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo() from test code, because it
	expects to be able to call the emulator, and for testing we have fake
	emulators that can't be executed. For that reason qemuxml2argvtest.c
	doesn't call qemuDomainAssignPCIAddresses(), instead it open codes its
	own version.

	That means we can't call qemuDomainAssignAddresses() from the test code,
	instead we need to manually call qemuDomainAssignSpaprVioAddresses().

	Also add logic to cope with qemuDomainAssignSpaprVioAddresses() failing,
	so that we can write a test that checks for a known failure in there.

	events: Return the correct number of registered events
	Commit d09f6ba5feb655925175dc80122ca2a1e14db2b9 introduced a regression in event
	registration.  virDomainEventCallbackListAddID() will only return a positive
	integer if the type of event being registered is VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE.
	For other event types, 0 is always returned on success.  This has the
	unfortunate side effect of not enabling remote event callbacks because
	remoteDomainEventRegisterAny() uses the return value from the local call to
	determine if an event callback needs to be registered on the remote end.

	Make sure virDomainEventCallbackListAddID() returns the callback count for the
	eventID being registered.

	Re-write LXC controller end-of-file I/O handling yet again
	Currently the LXC controller attempts to deal with EOF on a
	tty by spawning a thread to do an edge triggered epoll_wait().
	This avoids the normal event loop spinning on POLLHUP. There
	is a subtle mistake though - even after seeing POLLHUP on a
	master PTY, it is still perfectly possible & valid to write
	data to the PTY. There is a buffer that can be filled with
	data, even when no client is present.

	The second mistake is that the epoll_wait() thread was not
	looking for the EPOLLOUT condition, so when a new client
	connects to the LXC console, it had to explicitly send a
	character before any queued output would appear.

	Finally, there was in fact no need to spawn a new thread to
	deal with epoll_wait(). The epoll file descriptor itself
	can be poll()'d on normally.

	This patch attempts to deal with all these problems.

	 - The blocking epoll_wait() thread is replaced by a poll
	   on the epoll file descriptor which then does a non-blocking
	   epoll_wait() to handle events
	 - Even if POLLHUP is seen, we continue trying to write
	   any pending output until getting EAGAIN from write.
	 - Once write returns EAGAIN, we modify the epoll event
	   mask to also look for EPOLLOUT

	stream: Check for stream EOF
	If client stream does not have any data to sink and neither received
	EOF, a dummy packet is sent to the daemon signalising client is ready to
	sink some data. However, after we added event loop to client a race may
	occur:

	Thread 1 calls virNetClientStreamRecvPacket and since no data are cached
	nor stream has EOF, it decides to send dummy packet to server which will
	sent some data in turn. However, during this decision and actual message
	exchange with server -

	Thread 2 receives last stream data from server. Therefore an EOF is set
	on stream and if there is a call waiting (which is not yet) it is woken
	up. However, Thread 1 haven't sent anything so far, so there is no call
	to be woken up. So this thread sent dummy packet to daemon, which
	ignores that as no stream is associated with such packet and therefore
	no reply will ever come.

	This race causes client to hang indefinitely.

	build: fix build on mingw with netcf available
	The autobuilder pointed out an odd failure on mingw:
	../../src/interface/netcf_driver.c:644:5: error: unknown field 'close_used_without_including_unistd_h' specified in initializer
	cc1: warnings being treated as errors

	This is because the gnulib headers #define close to different strings,
	according to which headers are included, in order to work around some
	odd mingw problems with close(), and these defines happen to also
	affect field members declared with a name of struct foo.close. As long
	as all headers are included before both the definition and use of the
	struct, the various #define doesn't matter, but the netcf file hit
	an instance where things were included in a different order.  Fix this
	for all clients that use a struct member named 'close'.

	* src/driver.h: Include <unistd.h> before using 'close'.

	Add documentation new ways to access members of variables
	This patch adds documentation about the new 'ways' that users can
	access the contents of variables in filters:

	- access via index: $TEST[2]
	- access via iterators $TEST[@1]

2012-01-11  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Add test cases for new ways to access variables in filters
	This patch adds a couple of XML parser / schema validator test cases
	for the new 'ways' to access variables via index or iterator.

	Address side effects of accessing vars via index
	Address side effect of accessing a variable via an index: Filters
	accessing a variable where an element is accessed that is beyond the
	size of the list (for example $TEST[10] and only 2 elements are available)
	cannot instantiate that filter. Test for this and report proper error
	to user.

2012-01-11  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Add access to elements of variables via index
	This patch adds access to single elements of variables via index. Example:

	  <rule action='accept' direction='in' priority='500'>
	    <tcp srcipaddr='$ADDR[1]' srcportstart='$B[2]'/>
	  </rule>

2012-01-11  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Introduce possibility to have an iterator per variable
	This patch introduces the capability to use a different iterator per
	variable.

	The currently supported notation of variables in a filtering rule like

	  <rule action='accept' direction='out'>
	     <tcp  srcipaddr='$A' srcportstart='$B'/>
	  </rule>

	processes the two lists 'A' and 'B' in parallel. This means that A and B
	must have the same number of 'N' elements and that 'N' rules will be 
	instantiated (assuming all tuples from A and B are unique).

	In this patch we now introduce the assignment of variables to different
	iterators. Therefore a rule like

	  <rule action='accept' direction='out'>
	     <tcp  srcipaddr='$A[@1]' srcportstart='$B[@2]'/>
	  </rule>

	will now create every combination of elements in A with elements in B since
	A has been assigned to an iterator with Id '1' and B has been assigned to an
	iterator with Id '2', thus processing their value independently.

	The first rule has an equivalent notation of

	  <rule action='accept' direction='out'>
	     <tcp  srcipaddr='$A[@0]' srcportstart='$B[@0]'/>
	  </rule>

2012-01-11  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Optimize the elements the iterator visits.
	In this patch we introduce testing whether the iterator points to a
	unique set of entries that have not been seen before at one of the previous
	iterations. The point is to eliminate duplicates and with that unnecessary
	filtering rules by preventing identical filtering rules from being
	instantiated.
	Example with two lists:

	list1 = [1,2,1]
	list2 = [1,3,1]

	The 1st iteration would take the 1st items of each list -> 1,1
	The 2nd iteration would take the 2nd items of each list -> 2,3
	The 3rd iteration would take the 3rd items of each list -> 1,1 but
	skip them since this same pair has already been encountered in the 1st
	iteration

	Implementation-wise this is solved by taking the n-th element of list1 and
	comparing it against elements 1..n-1. If no equivalent is found, then there
	is no possibility of this being a duplicate. In case an equivalent element
	is found at position i, then the n-th element in the 2nd list is compared
	against the i-th element in the 2nd list and if that is not the same, then
	this is a unique pair, otherwise it is not unique and we may need to do
	the same comparison on the 3rd list.

	Change security driver APIs to use virDomainDefPtr instead of virDomainObjPtr
	When sVirt is integrated with the LXC driver, it will be neccessary
	to invoke the security driver APIs using only a virDomainDefPtr
	since the lxc_container.c code has no virDomainObjPtr available.
	Aside from two functions which want obj->pid, every bit of the
	security driver code only touches obj->def. So we don't need to
	pass a virDomainObjPtr into the security drivers, a virDomainDefPtr
	is sufficient. Two functions also gain a 'pid_t pid' argument.

	snapshot: allow reuse of existing files in disk snapshot
	When disk snapshots were first implemented, libvirt blindly refused
	to allow an external snapshot destination that already exists, since
	qemu will blindly overwrite the contents of that file during the
	snapshot_blkdev monitor command, and we don't like a default of
	data loss by default.  But VDSM has a scenario where NFS permissions
	are intentionally set so that the destination file can only be
	created by the management machine, and not the machine where the
	guest is running, so that libvirt will necessarily see the destination
	file already existing; adding a flag will allow VDSM to force the file
	reuse without libvirt complaining of possible data loss.

	qemu: check for kvm availability before starting kvm guests
	This *kind of* addresses:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=772395

	(it doesn't eliminate the failure to start, but causes libvirt to give
	a better idea about the cause of the failure).

	If a guest uses a kvm emulator (e.g. /usr/bin/qemu-kvm) and the guest
	is started when kvm isn't available (either because virtualization is
	unavailable / has been disabled in the BIOS, or the kvm modules
	haven't been loaded for some reason), a semi-cryptic error message is
	logged:

	  libvirtError: internal error Child process (LC_ALL=C
	  PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin /usr/bin/qemu-kvm -device ? -device
	  pci-assign,? -device virtio-blk-pci,? -device virtio-net-pci,?) status
	  unexpected: exit status 1

	This patch notices at process start that a guest needs kvm, and checks
	for the presence of /dev/kvm (a reasonable indicator that kvm is
	available) before trying to execute the qemu binary. If kvm isn't
	available, a more useful (too verbose??) error is logged.

	PolicyKit: Check auth before asking client to obtain it
	I previously mentioned [1] a PolicyKit issue where libvirt would
	proceed with authentication even though polkit-auth failed:

	testusr xen134:~> virsh list --all
	Attempting to obtain authorization for org.libvirt.unix.manage.
	polkit-grant-helper: given auth type (8 -> yes) is bogus
	Failed to obtain authorization for org.libvirt.unix.manage.
	 Id Name                 State
	----------------------------------
	  0 Domain-0             running
	  - sles11sp1-pv         shut off

	AFAICT, libvirt attempts to obtain a privilege it already has,
	causing polkit-auth to fail with above message.  Instead of calling
	obtain and then checking auth, IMO the workflow should be for the
	server to check auth first, and if that fails ask the client to
	obtain it and check again.  This workflow also allows for checking
	only successful exit of polkit-auth in virConnectAuthGainPolkit().

	qemu: add new disk device='lun' for bus='virtio' & type='block'
	In the past, generic SCSI commands issued from a guest to a virtio
	disk were always passed through to the underlying disk by qemu, and
	the kernel would also pass them on.

	As a result of CVE-2011-4127 (see:
	http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2011/q4/536), qemu now honors its
	scsi=on|off device option for virtio-blk-pci (which enables/disables
	passthrough of generic SCSI commands), and the kernel will only allow
	the commands for physical devices (not for partitions or logical
	volumes). The default behavior of qemu is still to allow sending
	generic SCSI commands to physical disks that are presented to a guest
	as virtio-blk-pci devices, but libvirt prefers to disable those
	commands in the standard virtio block devices, enabling it only when
	specifically requested (hopefully indicating that the requester
	understands what they're asking for). For this purpose, a new libvirt
	disk device type (device='lun') has been created.

	device='lun' is identical to the default device='disk', except that:

	1) It is only allowed if bus='virtio', type='block', and the qemu
	   version is "new enough" to support it ("new enough" == qemu 0.11 or
	   better), otherwise the domain will fail to start and a
	   CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED error will be logged).

	2) The option "scsi=on" will be added to the -device arg to allow
	   SG_IO commands (if device !='lun', "scsi=off" will be added to the
	   -device arg so that SG_IO commands are specifically forbidden).

	Guests which continue to use disk device='disk' (the default) will no
	longer be able to use SG_IO commands on the disk; those that have
	their disk device changed to device='lun' will still be able to use SG_IO
	commands.

	*docs/formatdomain.html.in - document the new device attribute value.
	*docs/schemas/domaincommon.rng - allow it in the RNG
	*tests/* - update the args of several existing tests to add scsi=off, and
	 add one new test that will test scsi=on.
	*src/conf/domain_conf.c - update domain XML parser and formatter

	*src/qemu/qemu_(command|driver|hotplug).c - treat
	 VIR_DOMAIN_DISK_DEVICE_LUN *almost* identically to
	 VIR_DOMAIN_DISK_DEVICE_DISK, except as indicated above.

	Note that no support for this new device value was added to any
	hypervisor drivers other than qemu, because it's unclear what it might
	mean (if anything) to those drivers.

	qemu: add capabilities flags related to SG_IO
	This patch adds two capabilities flags to deal with various aspects
	of supporting SG_IO commands on virtio-blk-pci devices:

	  QEMU_CAPS_VIRTIO_BLK_SCSI
	    set if -device virtio-blk-pci accepts the scsi="on|off" option
	    When present, this is on by default, but can be set to off to disable
	    SG_IO functions.

	  QEMU_CAPS_VIRTIO_BLK_SG_IO
	    set if SG_IO commands are supported in the virtio-blk-pci driver
	    (present since qemu 0.11 according to a qemu developer, if I
	     understood correctly)

	config: report error when script given for inappropriate interface type
	This fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=638633

	Although scripts are not used by interfaces of type other than
	"ethernet" in qemu, due to the fact that the parser stores the script
	name in a union that is only valid when type is ethernet or bridge,
	there is no way for anyone except the parser itself to catch the
	problem of specifying an interface script for an inappropriate
	interface type (by the time the parsed data gets back to the code that
	called the parser, all evidence that a script was specified is
	forgotten).

	Since the parser itself should be agnostic to which type of interface
	allows scripts (an example of why: a script specified for an interface
	of type bridge is valid for xen domains, but not for qemu domains),
	the solution here is to move the script out of the union(s) in the
	DomainNetDef, always populate it when specified (regardless of
	interface type), and let the driver decide whether or not it is
	appropriate.

	Currently the qemu, xen, libxml, and uml drivers recognize the script
	parameter and do something with it (the uml driver only to report that
	it isn't supported). Those drivers have been updated to log a
	CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED error when a script is specified for an interface
	type that's inappropriate for that particular hypervisor.

	(NB: There was earlier discussion of solving this problem by adding a
	VALIDATE flag to all libvirt APIs that accept XML, which would cause
	the XML to be validated against the RNG files. One statement during
	that discussion was that the RNG shouldn't contain hypervisor-specific
	things, though, and a proper solution to this problem would require
	that (again, because a script for an interface of type "bridge" is
	accepted by xen, but not by qemu).

	Implement DNS SRV record into the bridge driver
	Hi,
	this is the fifth version of my SRV record for DNSMasq patch rebased
	for the current codebase to the bridge driver and libvirt XML file to
	include support for the SRV records in the DNS. The syntax is based on
	DNSMasq man page and tests for both xml2xml and xml2argv were added as
	well. There are some things written a better way in comparison with
	version 4, mainly there's no hack in tests/networkxml2argvtest.c and
	also the xPath context is changed to use a simpler query using the
	virXPathInt() function relative to the current node.

	Also, the patch is also fixing the networkxml2argv test to pass both
	checks, i.e. both unit tests and also syntax check.

	Please review,
	Michal

	seclabel: honor device override in selinux
	This wires up the XML changes in the previous patch to let SELinux
	labeling honor user overrides, as well as affecting the live XML
	configuration in one case where the user didn't specify anything
	in the offline XML.

	I noticed that the logs contained messages like this:

	for all my domain images living on NFS.  But if we would just remember
	that on domain creation that we were unable to set a SELinux label (due to
	NFSv3 lacking labels, or NFSv4 not being configured to expose attributes),
	then we could avoid wasting the time trying to clear the label on
	domain shutdown.  This in turn is one less point of NFS failure,

	seclabel: extend XML to allow per-disk label overrides
	When doing security relabeling, there are cases where a per-file
	override might be appropriate.  For example, with a static label
	and relabeling, it might be appropriate to skip relabeling on a
	particular disk, where the backing file lives on NFS that lacks
	the ability to track labeling.  Or with dynamic labeling, it might
	be appropriate to use a custom (non-dynamic) label for a disk
	specifically intended to be shared across domains.

	The new XML resembles the top-level <seclabel>, but with fewer
	options (basically relabel='no', or <label>text</label>):

	<domain ...>
	  ...
	  <devices>
	    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
	      <source file='/path/to/image1'>
	        <seclabel relabel='no'/> <!-- override for just this disk -->
	      </source>
	      ...
	    </disk>
	    <disk type='file' device='disk'>
	      <source file='/path/to/image1'>
	        <seclabel relabel='yes'> <!-- override for just this disk -->
	          <label>system_u:object_r:shared_content_t:s0</label>
	        </seclabel>
	      </source>
	      ...
	    </disk>
	    ...
	  </devices>
	  <seclabel type='dynamic' model='selinux'>
	    <baselabel>text</baselabel> <!-- used for all devices without override -->
	  </seclabel>
	</domain>

	This patch only introduces the XML and documentation; future patches
	will actually parse and make use of it.  The intent is that we can
	further extend things as needed, adding a per-device <seclabel> in
	more places (such as the source of a console device), and possibly
	allowing a <baselabel> instead of <label> for labeling where we want
	to reuse the cNNN,cNNN pair of a dynamically labeled domain but a
	different base label.

	schema: rewrite seclabel rng to match code
	The RNG for <seclabel> was too strict - if it was present, then it
	had to have sub-elements, even if those didn't make sense for the
	given attributes.  Also, we didn't have any tests of <seclabel>
	parsing or XML output.

	In this patch, I added more parsing tests than output tests (since
	the output populates and/or reorders fields not present in certain
	inputs).  Making the RNG reliable is a precursor to using <seclabel>
	variants in more places in the XML in later patches.

	daemon: clean up daemonization
	Valgrind detected a pipe fd leak before the parent exits on success,
	introduced in commit 4296cea; by itself, the leak is not bad, since
	we immediately called _exit(), but we might as well be clean to make
	valgrind analysis easier.  Meanwhile, if the daemon grandchild detects
	an error, the parent failed to flush the error message before exiting.
	Also, we had the possibility of both parent and child returning to the
	caller, such that the user could see duplicated reports of failure
	from the two return paths.  And we might as well be robust to the
	(unlikely) situation of being started with stdin closed.

	* daemon/libvirtd.c (daemonForkIntoBackground): Use exit if an
	error message was generated, avoid fd leaks for valgrind's sake,
	avoid returning to caller in both parent and child, and don't
	close a just-dup'd stdin.
	Based on a report by Alex Jia.

	qemu: Add a capability flag for -no-acpi
	Currently non-x86 guests must have <acpi/> defined in <features> to
	prevent libvirt from running qemu with -no-acpi. Although it works, it
	is a hack.

	Instead add a capability flag which indicates whether qemu understands
	the -no-acpi option. Use it to control whether libvirt emits -no-acpi.

	Current versions of qemu always display -no-acpi in their help output,
	so this patch has no effect. However the development version of qemu
	has been modified such that -no-acpi is only displayed when it is
	actually supported.

	rpc: handle param_int, plug memory leaks
	The RPC code had several latent memory leaks and an attempt to
	free the wrong string, but thankfully nothing triggered them
	(blkiotune was the only one returning a string, and always as
	the last parameter).  Also, our cleanups for rpcgen ended up
	nuking a line of code that renders VIR_TYPED_PARAM_INT broken,
	because it was the only use of 'i' in a function, even though
	it was a member usage rather than a standalone declaration.

	Only add the timer when a callback is registered
	The lifetime of the virDomainEventState object is tied to
	the lifetime of the driver, which in stateless drivers is
	tied to the lifetime of the virConnectPtr.

	If we add & remove a timer when allocating/freeing the
	virDomainEventState object, we can get a situation where
	the timer still triggers once after virDomainEventState
	has been freed. The timeout callback can't keep a ref
	on the event state though, since that would be a circular
	reference.

	The trick is to only register the timer when a callback
	is registered with the event state & remove the timer
	when the callback is unregistered.

	The demo for the bug is to run

	  while true ; do date ; ../tools/virsh -q -c test:///default 'shutdown test; undefine test; dominfo test' ; done

	prior to this fix, it will frequently hang and / or
	crash, or corrupt memory

	Hide use of timers for domain event dispatch
	Currently all drivers using domain events need to provide a callback
	for handling a timer to dispatch events in a clean stack. There is
	no technical reason for dispatch to go via driver specific code. It
	could trivially be dispatched directly from the domain event code,
	thus removing tedious boilerplate code from all drivers

	Also fix the libxl & xen drivers to pass 'true' when creating the
	virDomainEventState, since they run inside the daemon & thus always
	expect events to be present.

	Add APIs to allow management of callbacks purely with virDomainEventState
	While virDomainEventState has APIs for managing removal of callbacks,

	When registering a callback for a particular event some callers

	Convert Xen & VBox drivers to use virDomainEventState

	migration: Add more specific error code/message on migration abort
	A generic error code was returned, if the user aborted a migration job.

	which is returned in the specific case of a user abort, while leaving
	all other failures with their existing code. This makes it easier to
	distinguish between failure while mirgrating and an user requested
	abort.

	Currently, on device detach, we parse given XML, find the device
	in domain object, free it and try to restore security labels.
	However, in some cases (e.g. usb hostdev) parsed XML contains
	less information than freed device. In usb case it is bus & device
	IDs. These are needed during label restoring as a symlink into
	/dev/bus is generated from them. Therefore don't drop device
	configuration until security labels are restored.

	virsh: Add option to undefine storage with domains
	Add an option for virsh undefine command, to remove associated storage
	volumes while undefining a domain. This patch allows the user to remove
	associated (libvirt managed ) storage volumes while undefining a domain.

	The new option --storage for the undefine command takes a string
	argument that consists of comma separated list of target or source path
	of volumes to be undefined. Volumes are removed after the domain has
	been successfully undefined,

	If a volume is not part of a storage pool, the user is warned to remove
	the volume in question himself.

	Option --wipe-storage may be specified along with this, that ensures
	the image is wiped before removing.

	Option --remove-all-storage enables the user to remove all storage. The
	name is chosen long as the users should be aware what they're about to
	do.

	qemu: Fix race between async and query jobs
	If an async job run on a domain will stop the domain at the end of the
	job, a concurrently run query job can hang in qemu monitor and nothing
	can be done with that domain from this point on. An attempt to start
	such domain results in "Timed out during operation: cannot acquire state
	change lock" error.

	However, quite a few things have to happen at the right time... There
	must be an async job running which stops a domain at the end. This race
	was reported with dump --crash but other similar jobs, such as
	(managed)save and migration, should be able to trigger this bug as well.
	While this async job is processing its last monitor command, that is a
	query-migrate to which qemu replies with status "completed", a new
	libvirt API that results in a query job must arrive and stay waiting
	until the query-migrate command finishes. Once query-migrate is done but
	before the async job closes qemu monitor while stopping the domain, the
	other thread needs to wake up and call qemuMonitorSend to send its
	command to qemu. Before qemu gets a chance to respond to this command,
	the async job needs to close the monitor. At this point, the query job
	thread is waiting for a condition that no-one will ever signal so it
	never finishes the job.

	qemu: Do not free the device from activePciHostdevs if it's in use
	* src/qemu/qemu_hostdev.c (qemuDomainReAttachHostdevDevices):
	pciDeviceListFree(pcidevs) in the end free()s the device even if
	it's in use by other domain, which can cause a race.

	How to reproduce:

	<script>

	virsh nodedev-dettach pci_0000_00_19_0
	virsh start test
	virsh attach-device test hostdev.xml
	virsh start test2

	for i in {1..5}; do
	        echo "[ -- ${i}th time --]"
	        virsh nodedev-reattach pci_0000_00_19_0
	done

	echo "clean up"
	virsh destroy test
	virsh nodedev-reattach pci_0000_00_19_0
	</script>

	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 dettached

	Domain test started

	Device attached successfully

	error: Failed to start domain test2
	error: Requested operation is not valid: PCI device 0000:00:19.0 is in use by domain test

	[ -- 1th time --]
	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 re-attached

	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 re-attached

	[ -- 4th time --]
	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 re-attached

	[ -- 5th time --]
	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 re-attached

	clean up
	Domain test destroyed

	Device pci_0000_00_19_0 re-attached

	The patch also fixes another problem, there won't be error like
	"qemuDomainReAttachHostdevDevices: Not reattaching active
	device 0000:00:19.0" in daemon log if some device is in active.
	As pciResetDevice and pciReattachDevice won't be called for
	the device anymore. This is sensible as we already reported
	error when preparing the device if it's active. Blindly trying
	to pciResetDevice & pciReattachDevice on the device and getting
	an error is just redundant.

	    2) The device won't be reattached to host with original

	       properties which are maintained by driver->activePciHostdevs.

	storage: Fix a potential crash when creating vol object
	If the vol object is newly created, it increases the volumes count,
	but doesn't decrease the volumes count when do cleanup. It can
	cause libvirtd to crash when one trying to free the volume objects
	like:
	    for (i = 0; i < pool->volumes.count; i++)
	        virStorageVolDefFree(pool->volumes.objs[i]);

	It's more reliable if we add the newly created vol object in the

	build: follow directory install conventions
	Commit 4d9e51f6 fixed a 'make uninstall' failure, but failed
	to follow other conventions already present in src/Makefile.am.
	In particular, we prefer MKDIR_P over mkdir -p, and should
	have a matching rmdir during uninstall for every directory
	created during install (the idea being that uninstall in a
	DESTDIR should be clean, while installation in the final
	system should not fail with non-empty directories left behind).

	* tools/Makefile.am (install-sysconfig, install-initscript)
	(install-systemd): Use MKDIR_P.
	(uninstall-sysconfig, uninstall-initscript, uninstall-systemd):

	qemu: Disable EOF processing during qemuDomainDestroy
	When destroying a domain qemuDomainDestroy kills its qemu process and
	starts a new job, which means it unlocks the domain object and locks it
	again after some time. Although the object is usually unlocked for a
	pretty short time, chances are another thread processing an EOF event on
	qemu monitor is able to lock the object first and does all the cleanup
	by itself. This leads to wrong shutoff reason and lifecycle event detail
	and virDomainDestroy API incorrectly reporting failure to destroy an
	inactive domain.

	Reported by Charlie Smurthwaite.

	test: replace deprecated "fedora-13" machine with "pc-0.13"
	One of the xml tests in the test suite was created using a
	now-deprecated qemu machine type ("fedora-13", which was only ever
	valid for Fedora builds of qemu). Although strictly speaking it's not
	necessary to replace it with an actual supported qemu machine type
	(since the xml in question is never actually sent to qemu), this patch
	changes it to the actually-supported "pc-0.13" just for general
	tidiness. (Also, on some Fedora builds which contain a special patch
	to rid the world of "fedora-13", having it mentioned in the test suite
	will cause make check to fail.)

	network: don't add iptables rules for externally managed networks
	This patch addresses https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=760442

	When a network has any forward type other than route, nat or none, the
	network configuration should be done completely external to libvirt -
	libvirt only uses these types to allow configuring guests in a manner
	that isn't tied to a specific host (all the host-specific information,
	in particular interface names, port profile data, and bandwidth
	configuration is in the network definition, and the guest
	configuration only references it).

	Due to a bug in the bridge network driver, libvirt was adding iptables
	rules for networks with forward type='bridge' etc. any time libvirtd
	was restarted while one of these networks was active.

	This patch eliminates that error by only "reloading" iptables rules if
	forward type is route, nat, or none.

	In QEMU PPC64 we have a network device called "spapr-vlan". We can specify

	Pass the VM's UUID into the nwfilter subsystem
	A preparatory patch for DHCP snooping where we want to be able to
	differentiate between a VM's interface using the tuple of
	<VM UUID, Interface MAC address>. We assume that MAC addresses could
	possibly be re-used between different networks (VLANs) thus do not only
	want to rely on the MAC address to identify an interface.

	At the current 'final destination' in virNWFilterInstantiate I am leaving
	the vmuuid parameter as ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED until the DHCP snooping patches arrive.
	(we may not post the DHCP snooping patches for 0.9.9, though)

	Mostly this is a pretty trivial patch. On the lowest layers, in lxc_driver
	and uml_conf, I am passing the virDomainDefPtr around until I am passing

	Commit ecd8725 tried to silence a spurious warning on the initial

	set, then 0%{rhel} <= 6 made the %if always true.  Checking for
	minimum versions (via >=) is okay, but checking for maximum versions
	(via <=) requires a prerequisite test that the platform being tested
	is non-zero.

	Also fix a bogus setting of with_libxl (although we previously

	Clean up qemuBuildCommandLine to remove x86-specific
	 assumptions from generic code.

	This implements the minimal set of changes needed in libvirt to launch a
	PowerPC-KVM based guest.
	It removes x86-specific assumptions about choice of serial driver backend
	from generic qemu guest commandline generation code.
	It also restricts the ACPI capability to be available for an x86 or
	x86_64 domain.
	This is not a complete solution -- it still does not guarantee libvirt
	the capability to flag non-supported options in guest XML. (Eg, an ACPI
	specification in a PowerPC guest XML will still get processed, even
	though qemu-system-ppc64 does not support it while qemu-system-x86_64 does.)
	This drawback exists because libvirt falls back on qemu to query supported
	features, and qemu '-h' blindly lists all capabilities -- irrespective
	of whether they are available while emulating a given architecture or not.
	The long-term solution would be for qemu to list out capabilities based
	on architecture and platform -- so that libvirt can cleanly make out what
	devices are supported on an arch (say 'ppc64') and platform (say, 'mac99').

	Add support for ppc64 qemu
	This enables libvirt to select the correct qemu binary (qemu-system-ppc64)
	for a guest vm based on arch 'ppc64'.
	Also, libvirt is enabled to correctly parse the list of supported PowerPC
	CPUs, generated by running 'qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu ?'

	Use sysfs to gather host topology, in place of
	 /proc/cpuinfo

	Libvirt at present depends on /proc/cpuinfo to gather host
	details such as CPUs, cores, threads, etc. This is an architecture-
	dependent approach. An alternative is to use 'Sysfs', which provides
	a platform-agnostic interface to parse host CPU topology.

	Fix updating of haveTheBuck in RPC client to be race-free
	When one thread passes the buck to another thread, it uses
	virCondSignal to wake up the target thread. The variable
	'haveTheBuck' is not updated in a race-free manner when
	this occurs. The current thread sets it to false, and the
	woken up thread sets it to true. There is a window where
	a 3rd thread can come in and grab the buck.

	Even if this didn't lead to crashes & deadlocks, this would
	still result in unfairness in the buckpassing algorithm.

	A better solution is to *never* set haveTheBuck to false
	when we're passing the buck. Only set it to false when there
	is no further thread waiting for the buck.

	qemu: Rework handling of shutdown event
	When QEMU guest finishes its shutdown sequence, qemu stops virtual CPUs
	and when started with -no-shutdown waits for us to kill it using
	SGITERM. Since QEMU is flushing its internal buffers, some time may pass
	before QEMU actually dies. We mistakenly used "paused" state (and
	events) for this which is quite confusing since users may see a domain
	going to pause while they expect it to shutdown. Since we already have
	"shutdown" state with "the domain is being shut down" semantics, we
	should use it for this state.

	However, the state didn't have a corresponding event so I created one
	and called its detail as VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SHUTDOWN_FINISHED (guest OS
	finished its shutdown sequence) with the intent to add
	VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SHUTDOWN_STARTED in the future if we have a
	sufficiently capable guest agent that can notify us when guest OS starts
	to shutdown.

	build: require more tools from maintainers
	We want our tarballs to be complete - this means that any
	generated file that gets shipped as part of the tarball so that
	ordinary users don't have to rebuild it must be something
	that the maintainer can generate.  There have been various
	reports of random build failures when using libvirt.git
	instead of a tarball, and often it is due to missing a
	maintainer-specific tool to produce one of these generated
	files.  This patch raises the bar for what you must have
	installed to build libvirt.git, but does not impact what
	you can get away with for building tarballs.

	build: fix build at -O2 on rawhide
	I had previously tested commit 059d746 with -O intentionally omitted
	from my CFLAGS; but that means that I missed out on this warning
	from gcc 4.6.2 when optimizations are enabled:

	util/buf.c: In function 'virBufferGetIndent':
	util/buf.c:86:1: error: function might be candidate for attribute 'pure' [-Werror=suggest-attribute=pure]

	While it is probably a good idea to add the attributes and silence
	this warning, it's also invasive; 'make -k' found more than 75 such
	complaints.  And it doesn't help that gcc 4.6.2 is still buggy
	(coreutils reported a case where gcc 4.6.2 incorrectly suggested
	marking a function pure that incremented a global variable; fixed
	in gcc 4.7).  So the best fix for now is to disable the warning.

	It also doesn't help that I stumbled across another problem - gcc
	documents that -Wsuggest-attribute=pure only warns if you use -O,
	or if you use -fipa-pure-const.  But in practice, when I omitted -O
	but added -fipa-pure-const, the warnings are fickle - I got warnings
	for simple compilation that disappeared when I also added -fPIC.
	And the way libtool compiles things is with -fPIC first, then without
	-fPIC but with errors sent to /dev/null - which meant that without
	disabling -Wsuggest-attribute=pure, I got a compile error with no
	message.  :(  See http://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10197

	* m4/virt-compile-warnings.m4 (LIBVIRT_COMPILE_WARNINGS): Silence
	-Wsuggest-attribute warnings for now.

	The pathname for the pipe for tunnelled migration is unresolvable.  The

	we should have given permission to the file but didn't.  Otherwise
	(especially since this is a /proc/$$/fd/N file) the file is already open
	and libvirt won't be refused access by apparmor anyway.

	client: Check if other thread claims it has the buck before claiming it.
	Originaly, the code checked if another client is the queue and infered
	ownership of the buck from that. Commit fa9595003d043df9f2efe95521c008
	added a separate variable to track the buck. That caused, that a new
	call might enter claiming it has the buck, while another thread was
	signalled to take the buck. This ends in two threads claiming they hold
	the buck and entering poll(). This happens due to a race on waking up
	threads on the client lock mutex.

	This caused multi-threaded clients to hang, most prominently visible and
	reproducible on python based clients, like virt-manager.

	build: fix 'make dist' without dtrace
	probes.h can only be generated on Linux, and then only with dtrace
	installed.  If it is part of the tarball, then either 'make dist'
	will fail if you don't have that setup, or we would have to start
	keeping probes.h in libvirt.git.  Since we only need it to be
	generated when dtrace is in use, it's better to avoid shipping
	it in the first place, and avoid tracking it in git.

	Meanwhile, there is a build dependency - since the RPC code is
	generated, it can be built early; but when dtrace is enabled, we
	must ensure probes.h is built even earlier.  Commit 1afcfbdd tried
	to fix this, but did so in a way that added probes.h into the
	tarball, and broke VPATH as well.  Commit ecbca767 fixed VPATH,
	but didn't fix the more fundamental problem.  This patch solves
	the issue by adding a dependency instead.

	Tested with 'make dist' in a clean VPATH builds, for both
	'./configure --without-dtrace' and './configure --with-dtrace';
	all configurations were able to correctly build a tarball, and
	the dtrace configuration no longer sticks probes.h in the tarball.

	bridge_driver: Don't define network if XML contains more IPv4 adreses.
	Only one IPv4 DHCP definition is supported. Originally the code checked
	for a multiple definition and returned an error, but the new domain

	before the newly defined network is added to active networks.

	spec: mark directories in /var/run as ghosts
	We have several directories that are created on the fly, and which
	only contain state relevant to a running libvirtd process (all
	located in /var/run).  Since the directories are created as needed,
	and make no sense without a running libvirtd, we want them deleted
	if libvirt is uninstalled.  And in F15 and newer, /var/run is on
	tmpfs (forcing us to recreate on the fly); which means that someone
	trying to verify a complete rpm will fail if the directory does not
	currently exist because libvirtd has not been started since boot.
	The solution, then, is to mark the directories as %ghost, so that
	rpm knows that we own them and will clean it up if libvirt is
	uninstalled, but will no longer create the directory for us at
	install, nor complain at verify time if the directory does not exist.

	See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=656611.

	* libvirt.spec.in (%files): Add %ghost to temporary directories
	that we don't install, but want cleaned up on libvirt removal.

	qemu: filter blkio 0-device-weight at two other places
	filter 0-device-weight when:

	  - getting blkio parameters with --config
	  - starting up a domain

	When testing with blkio, I found these issues:

	  (dom is down)
	  virsh blkiotune dom --device-weights /dev/sda,300,/dev/sdb,500
	  virsh blkiotune dom --device-weights /dev/sda,300,/dev/sdb,0
	  virsh blkiotune dom
	  weight         : 800
	  device_weight  : /dev/sda,200,/dev/sdb,0

	  # issue 1: shows 0 device weight of /dev/sdb that may confuse user

	  (continued)
	  virsh start dom

	  # issue 2: If /dev/sdb doesn't exist, libvirt refuses to bring the
	  # dom up because it wants to set the device weight to 0 of a
	  # non-existing device. Since 0 means no weight-limit, we really don't
	  # have to set it.

2011-12-01  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	qemu: amend existing table of device weights
	Prior to this patch, for a running dom, the commands:

	$ virsh blkiotune dom --device-weights /dev/sda,502,/dev/sdb,498
	$ virsh blkiotune dom --device-weights /dev/sda,503
	$ virsh blkiotune dom
	weight         : 500
	device_weight  : /dev/sda,503

	claim that /dev/sdb no longer has a non-default weight, but
	directly querying cgroups says otherwise:

	$ cat /cgroup/blkio/libvirt/qemu/dom/blkio.weight_device
	8:0     503
	8:16    498

	After this patch, an explicit 0 is required to remove a device path
	from the XML, and omitting a device path that was previously
	specified leaves that device path untouched in the XML, to match
	cgroups behavior.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (parseBlkioWeightDeviceStr): Rename...
	(qemuDomainParseDeviceWeightStr): ...and use correct type.
	(qemuDomainSetBlkioParameters): After parsing string, modify
	rather than replacing existing table.

	The next patch will make it possible to have virDomainSetBlkioParameters

	duplicate paths.  Technically, a user can still confuse libvirt by
	passing alternate spellings that resolve to the same device, but it
	is not worth worrying about working around that kind of abuse.

	Add internal APIs for dealing with time
	The logging APIs need to be able to generate formatted timestamps
	using only async signal safe functions. This rules out using
	gmtime/localtime/malloc/gettimeday(!) and much more.

	Introduce a new internal API which is async signal safe.

	  virTimeMillisNowRaw replacement for gettimeofday. Uses clock_gettime
	                      where available, otherwise falls back to the unsafe
	                      gettimeofday

	                       replacement is provided, because converting to
	                       local time is not practical with only async signal
	                       safe APIs.

	  virTimeStringThenRaw into a string, using a pre-determined format, with
	                       a fixed size buffer (VIR_TIME_STRING_BUFLEN)

	Add virsh command to initiate suspend on the host
	Add a new command 'nodesuspend' to perform a timed suspend on the host.

2011-11-29  Srivatsa S. Bhat  <srivatsa.bhat@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Implement the core API to suspend/resume the host
	Add the core functions that implement the functionality of the API.
	Suspend is done by using an asynchronous mechanism so that we can return
	the status to the caller before the host gets suspended. This asynchronous
	operation is achieved by suspending the host in a separate thread of
	execution. However, returning the status to the caller is only best-effort,
	but not guaranteed.

	To resume the host, an RTC alarm is set up (based on how long we want to
	suspend) before suspending the host. When this alarm fires, the host
	gets woken up.

	Suspend-to-RAM operation on a host running Linux can take upto more than 20
	seconds, depending on the load of the system. (Freezing of tasks, an operation
	preceding any suspend operation, is given up after a 20 second timeout).
	And Suspend-to-Disk can take even more time, considering the time required
	for compaction, creating the memory image and writing it to disk etc.
	So, we do not allow the user to specify a suspend duration of less than 60
	seconds, to be on the safer side, since we don't want to prematurely declare
	failure when we only had to wait for some more time.

	usual system-wide sleep states such as Suspend-to-RAM (S3) or Suspend-to-Disk

	Fix version numbers for isAlive and setKeepAlive driver APIs

	build: Properly generate and check virkeepaliveprotocol-structs
	This fixes make dist broken by recent keepalive series

	examples: Use virConnectOpenAuth in events-c

	qemu: Cancel p2p migration when connection breaks
	If a connection to destination host is lost during peer-to-peer
	migration (because keepalive protocol timed out), we won't be able to
	finish the migration and it doesn't make sense to wait for qemu to
	transmit all data. This patch automatically cancels such migration
	without waiting for virDomainAbortJob to be called.

	qemu: Add support for keepalive messages during p2p migration

	Add keepalive support into domain-events examples

	Implement virConnectIsAlive in all drivers

	Introduce virConnectIsAlive API
	This API can be used to check if the socket associated with
	virConnectPtr is still open or it was closed (probably because keepalive
	protocol timed out). If there the connection is local (i.e., no socket
	is associated with the connection, it is trivially always alive.

	Implement keepalive protocol in remote driver

	Add support for async close of client RPC socket

	Implement keepalive protocol in libvirt daemon

	virsh: Always run event loop
	Since virsh already implements event loop, it has to also run it. So far
	the event loop was only running during virsh console command.

	Introduce virConnectSetKeepAlive
	virConnectSetKeepAlive public API can be used by a client connecting to
	remote server to start using keepalive protocol. The API is handled
	directly by remote driver and not transmitted over the wire to the
	server.

	Implement common keepalive handling
	These APIs are used by both client and server RPC layer to handle
	processing of keepalive messages.

	Define keepalive protocol
	The keepalive program has two procedures: PING, and PONG.
	Both are used only in asynchronous messages and the sender doesn't wait
	for any reply. However, the party which receives PING messages is
	supposed to react by sending PONG message the other party, but no
	explicit binding between PING and PONG messages is made. For backward
	compatibility neither server nor client are allowed to send keepalive
	messages before checking that remote party supports them.

	rpc: Add some debug messages to virNetClient

	rpc: Fix handling of non-blocking calls that could not be sent
	When virNetClientIOEventLoop is called for a non-blocking call and not

	properly reported that to the caller which properly frees the call. But
	we never removed the call from a call queue.

	Export KVM Host Power Management capabilities
	This patch exports KVM Host Power Management capabilities as XML so that
	higher-level systems management software can make use of these features
	available in the host.

	The script "pm-is-supported" (from pm-utils package) is run to discover if
	Suspend-to-RAM (S3) or Suspend-to-Disk (S4) is supported by the host.
	If either of them are supported, then a new tag "<power_management>" is
	introduced in the XML under the <host> tag.

	However in case the query to check for power management features succeeded,
	but the host does not support any such feature, then the XML will contain
	an empty <power_management/> tag. In the event that the PM query itself
	failed, the XML will not contain any "power_management" tag.

	To use this, new APIs could be implemented in libvirt to exploit power
	management features such as S3/S4.

	qemu: don't release network actual device twice
	For direct attach devices, in qemuBuildCommandLine, we seem to be freeing
	actual device on error path (with networkReleaseActualDevice). But the actual
	device is not deleted.

	qemuProcessStop eventually deletes the direct attach device and releases
	actual device. But by the time qemuProcessStop is called qemuBuildCommandLine
	has already freed actual device, leaving stray macvtap devices behind on error.

	VALID NAMES
	The following characters are valid for VG and LV names: a-z A-Z 0-9 + _

	Don't copy sexpr node value that is an empty string
	Xen4.1 initializes some unspecified sexpr config items to an empty
	string, unlike previous Xen versions that would leave the item unset.

	Xen4.0 and earlier
	  ...
	  (image

	  ...

	Xen4.1
	  ...
	  (image
	    (hvm

	  ...

	The empty string for kernel causes some grief in subsequent parsing
	where existence of specified kernel is checked, e.g.

	  if (!def->os.kernel)
	  ...

	This patch solves the problem in sexpr_node_copy() by not copying
	a node containing an empty string.

	tests: avoid xend ABRT crash report
	I installed the xen development packages on my non-Xen F16 machine
	in order to compile-test xen code and ensure we don't break things
	on that front, but being a non-xen machine, /usr/sbin/xend is
	obviously not running.  Unfortunately, xen-4.1.2-1.fc16 has a bug
	where merely trying to probe xend status on a non-xen kernel causes
	xend to issue an ABRT crash report:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=728696

	Even though libvirt (correctly) skips the test, the xend crash report
	is unnecessary noise.  Fix this by first filtering out non-xen
	kernels even before attempting to probe xend.  The test still runs
	and passes on a RHEL 5 xen kernel after this patch.

	Add test cases for parsing of list values
	This patch adds test cases for parsing of parameters with
	multiple occurrances of the same name.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Extend NWFilter parameter parser to cope with lists of values
	This patch modifies the NWFilter parameter parser to support multiple
	elements with the same name and to internally build a list of items.
	An example of the XML looks like this:

	        <parameter name='TEST' value='10.1.2.3'/>
	        <parameter name='TEST' value='10.2.3.4'/>
	        <parameter name='TEST' value='10.1.1.1'/>

	The list of values is then stored in the newly introduced data type
	virNWFilterVarValue.

	The XML formatter is also adapted to print out all items in alphabetical
	order sorted by 'name'.

	This patch also fixes a bug in the XML schema on the way.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Create rules for each member of a list
	This patch extends the NWFilter driver for Linux (ebiptables) to create
	rules for each member of a previously introduced list. If for example
	an attribute value (internally) looks like this:

	IP = [10.0.0.1, 10.0.0.2, 10.0.0.3]

	then 3 rules will be generated for a rule accessing the variable 'IP',
	one for each member of the list. The effect of this is that this now
	allows for filtering for multiple values in one field. This can then be
	used to support for filtering/allowing of multiple IP addresses per
	interface.

	An iterator is introduced that extracts each member of a list and
	puts it into a hash table which then is passed to the function creating
	a rule. For the above example the iterator would cause 3 loops.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Rework value part of name-value pairs
	NWFilters can be provided name-value pairs using the following
	XML notation:

	      <filterref filter='xyz'>
	        <parameter name='PORT' value='80'/>
	        <parameter name='VAL' value='abc'/>
	      </filterref>

	The internal representation currently is so that a name is stored as a
	string and the value as well. This patch now addresses the value part of it
	and introduces a data structure for storing a value either as a simple
	value or as an array for later support of lists.

	This patch adjusts all code that was handling the values in hash tables
	and makes it use the new data type.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Documentation about chains' priorities, lists of elements etc.
	This patch adds several aspects of documentation about the network filtering
	system:

	- chains, chains' priorities and chains' default priorities
	- talks about lists of elements, i.e., a variable assigned multiple values
	  (part of already ACK-ed series)
	- already mentions the vlan, stp and mac chains added later on

	- mentions limitations of vlan filtering (when sent by VM) on Linux systems

	Add test case for the chain names with known prefixes and the chain
	priority.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Interleave jumping into chains with filtering rules in 'root' table
	The previous patch extends the priority of filtering rules into negative
	numbers. We now use this possibility to interleave the jumping into
	chains with filtering rules to for example create the 'root' table of
	an interface with the following sequence of rules:

	Bridge chain: libvirt-I-vnet0, entries: 6, policy: ACCEPT
	-p IPv4 -j I-vnet0-ipv4
	-p ARP -j I-vnet0-arp
	-p ARP -j ACCEPT 
	-p 0x8035 -j I-vnet0-rarp
	-p 0x835 -j ACCEPT 
	-j DROP 

	The '-p ARP -j ACCEPT' rule now appears between the jumps.
	Since the 'arp' chain has been assigned priority -700 and the 'rarp'
	chain -600, the above ordering can now be achieved with the following
	rule:

	  <rule action='accept' direction='out' priority='-650'>
	    <mac protocolid='arp'/>
	  </rule>

	This patch now sorts the commands generating the above shown jumps into
	chains and interleaves their execution with those for generating rules.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Extend rule priorities into negative numbers
	So far rules' priorities have only been valid in the range [0,1000].
	Now I am extending their priority into the range [-1000, 1000] for subsequently
	being able to sort rules and the access of (jumps into) chains following
	priorities.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Enable chains with names having a known prefix
	This patch enables chains that have a known prefix in their name.
	Known prefixes are: 'ipv4', 'ipv6', 'arp', 'rarp'. All prefixes
	are also protocols that can be evaluated on the ebtables level.

	Following the prefix they will be automatically connected to an interface's
	'root' chain and jumped into following the protocol they evaluate, i.e.,
	a table 'arp-xyz' will be accessed from the root table using

	ebtables -t nat -A <iface root table> -p arp -j I-<ifname>-arp-xyz

	thus generating a 'root' chain like this one here:

	Bridge chain: libvirt-O-vnet0, entries: 5, policy: ACCEPT
	-p IPv4 -j O-vnet0-ipv4
	-p ARP -j O-vnet0-arp
	-p 0x8035 -j O-vnet0-rarp
	-p ARP -j O-vnet0-arp-xyz
	-j DROP 

	where the chain 'arp-xyz' is accessed for filtering of ARP packets.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Extend the filter XML to support priorities of chains
	This patch extends the filter XML to support priorities of chains
	in the XML. An example would be:

	<filter name='allow-arpxyz' chain='arp-xyz' priority='200'>
	[...]
	</filter>

	The permitted values for priorities are [-1000, 1000].
	By setting the priority of a chain the order in which it is accessed
	from the interface root chain can be influenced.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Use the actual names of chains in data structure
	Use the name of the chain rather than its type index (enum).
	This pushes the later enablement of chains with user-given names
	into the XML parser. For now we still only allow those names that
	are well known ('root', 'arp', 'rarp', 'ipv4' and 'ipv6').

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Use scripting for cleaning and renaming of chains
	Use scripts for the renaming and cleaning up of chains. This allows us to get
	rid of some of the code that is only capable of renaming and removing chains
	whose names are hardcoded.

	A shell function 'collect_chains' is introduced that is given the name
	of an ebtables chain and then recursively determines the names of all
	chains that are accessed from this chain and its sub-chains using 'jumps'.

	The resulting list of chain names is then used to delete all the found
	chains by first flushing and then deleting them.

	The same function is also used for renaming temporary filters to their final
	names.

	I tested this with the bash and dash as script interpreters.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Make filter creation in root table more flexible
	Use the previously introduced chain priorities to sort the chains for access
	from an interface's 'root' table and have them created in the proper order.
	This gets rid of a lot of code that was previously creating the chains in a 
	more hardcoded way.

	To determine what protocol a filter is used for evaluation do prefix-
	matching, i.e., the filter 'arp' is used to filter for the 'arp' protocol,
	'ipv4' for the 'ipv4' protocol and 'arp-xyz' will also be used to filter
	for the 'arp' protocol following the prefix 'arp' in its name.

2011-11-19  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Introduce an internal priority for chains
	For better handling of the sorting of chains introduce an internally used
	priority. Use a lookup table to store the priorities. For now their actual
	values do not matter just that the values cause the chains to be properly
	sorted through changes in the following patches. However, the values are
	chosen as negative so that once they are sorted along with filtering rules
	(whose priority may only be positive for now) they will always be instantiated
	before them (lower values cause instantiation before higher values). This
	is done to maintain backwards compatibility.

	Add function to get hash table's key/value pairs
	Add a function to the virHashTable for getting an array of the hash table's
	key-value pairs and have the keys (optionally) sorted.

	Add support for systemd init service
	This patch adds support for a systemd init service for libvirtd
	and libvirt-guests. The libvirtd.service is *not* written to use
	socket activation, since we want libvirtd to start on boot so it
	can do guest auto-start.

	The libvirt-guests.service is pretty lame, just exec'ing the
	original init script for now. Ideally we would factor out the
	functionality, into some shared tool.

	Instead of

	  ./configure --with-init-script=redhat

	You can now do

	  ./configure --with-init-script=systemd

	Or better still:

	  ./configure --with-init-script=systemd+redhat

	We can also now support install of the upstart init script

	* configure.ac: Add systemd, and systemd+redhat options to
	  --with-init-script option
	* daemon/Makefile.am: Install systemd services
	* daemon/libvirtd.sysconf: Add note about unused env variable
	  with systemd
	* daemon/libvirtd.service.in: libvirtd systemd service unit
	* libvirt.spec.in: Add scripts to installing systemd services
	  and migrating from legacy init scripts
	* tools/Makefile.am: Install systemd services
	* tools/libvirt-guests.init.sh: Rename to tools/libvirt-guests.init.in
	* tools/libvirt-guests.service.in: systemd service unit

	Refactor LXC network setup to allow future enhancements

	Add missing 'const' annotations for internal domain conf helpers
	The virDomainNetGetActualBridgeName and virDomainNetGetActualDirectDev

	struct, and should therefore not be freed. The return values should
	thus be 'const char *' not 'char *'.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Mark const
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Update to use a const char *

	snapshot: refuse to generate names for non-regular backing files
	For whatever reason, the kernel allows you to create a regular
	file named /dev/sdc.12345; although this file will disappear the
	next time devtmpfs is remounted.  If you let libvirt generate
	the name of the external snapshot for a disk image originally
	using the block device /dev/sdc, then the domain will be rendered
	unbootable once the qcow2 file is lost on the next devtmpfs
	remount.  In this case, the user should have used 'virsh
	snapshot-create --xmlfile' or 'virsh snapshot-create-as --diskspec'
	to specify the name for the qcow2 file in a sane location, rather
	than relying on libvirt generating a name that is most likely to
	be wrong.  We can help avoid naive mistakes by enforcing that
	the user provide the external name for any backing file that is
	not a regular file.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c (virDomainSnapshotAlignDisks): Only
	generate names if backing file exists as regular file.

	virsh: add iface-bridge and iface-unbridge commands
	One of the top questions by libvirt users is how to create a host
	bridge device so that guests can be directly on the physical
	network. There are several example documents that explain how to do
	this manually, but following them often results in confusion and
	failure. virt-manager does a good job of creating a bridge based on an
	existing network device, but not everyone wants to use virt-manager.

	This patch adds a new command, iface-bridge that makes it just about
	as simple as possible to create a new bridge device based on an
	existing ethernet/vlan/bond device (including associating IP
	configuration with the bridge rather than the now-attached device),
	and start that new bridge up ready for action, eg:

	    virsh iface-bridge eth0 br0

	For symmetry's sake, it also adds a command to remove a device from a
	bridge, restoring the IP config to the now-unattached device:

	    virsh iface-unbridge br0

	(I had a short debate about whether to do "iface-unbridge eth0"
	instead, but that would involve searching through all bridge devices
	for the one that contained eth0, which seems like a bit too much
	trouble).

	NOTE: These two commands require that the netcf library be available
	on the host. Hopefully this will provide some extra incentive for
	people using suse, debian, ubuntu, and other similar systems to polish
	up (and push downstream) the ports to those distros recently pushed to
	the upstream netcf repo by Dan Berrange. Anyone interested in helping
	with that effort in any way should join the netcf-devel mailing list
	(subscription info at
	https://fedorahosted.org/mailman/listinfo/netcf-devel)

	During creation of the bridge, it's possible to specify whether or not
	the STP protocol should be started up on the bridge and, if so, how
	many seconds the bridge should squelch traffic from newly added
	devices while learning new topology (defaults are stp='on' and
	delay='0', which seems to usually work best for bridges used in the
	context of libvirt guests).

	There is also an option to not immediately start the bridge (and a
	similar option to not immediately start the un-attached device after
	destroying the bridge. Default is to start the new device, because in
	the case of iface-unbridge not starting is strongly discouraged as it
	will leave the system with no network connectivity on that interface
	(because it's necessary to destroy/undefine the bridge device before
	the unattached device can be defined), and it seemed better to make
	the option for iface-bridge behave consistently.

	NOTE TO THOSE TRYING THESE COMMANDS FOR THE FIRST TIME: to guard
	against any "unexpected" change to configuration, it is advisable to
	issue an "virsh iface-begin" command before starting any interface
	config changes, and "virsh iface-commit" only after you've verified
	that everything is working as you expect. If something goes wrong,
	you can always run "virsh iface-rollback" or reboot the system (which
	should automatically do iface-rollback).

	Aside from adding the code for these two functions, and the two
	entries into the command table, the only other change to virsh.c was
	to add the option name to vshCommandOptInterfaceBy(), because the
	iface-unbridge command names its interface option as "bridge".

	virsh.pod has also been updated with short descriptions of these two
	new commands.

	qemu/rbd: improve rbd device specification
	This improves the support for qemu rbd devices by adding support for a few
	key features (e.g., authentication) and cleaning up the way in which
	rbd configuration options are passed to qemu.

	An <auth> member of the disk source xml specifies how librbd should
	authenticate. The username attribute is the Ceph/RBD user to authenticate as.
	The usage or uuid attributes specify which secret to use. Usage is an
	arbitrary identifier local to libvirt.

	The old RBD support relied on setting an environment variable to
	communicate information to qemu/librbd.  Instead, pass those options
	explicitly to qemu.  Update the qemu argument parsing and tests
	accordingly.

	storage: forbid rebuilding existing disk storage pools
	which would blow away all volumes. Honor VIR_STORAGE_POOL_BUILD_OVERWRITE
	to force a rebuild.

	This was caught by libvirt-tck's storage/110-disk-pool.t.

	API: add trivial qemu support for VIR_TYPED_PARAM_STRING
	Qemu will be the first driver to make use of a typed string in the
	next round of additions.  Separate out the trivial addition.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudSupportsFeature): Advertise feature.
	(qemuDomainGetBlkioParameters, qemuDomainGetMemoryParameters)
	(qemuGetSchedulerParametersFlags, qemudDomainBlockStatsFlags):
	Allow typed strings flag where trivially supported.

2011-11-12  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	API: remote support for VIR_TYPED_PARAM_STRING
	Send and receive string typed parameters across RPC.  This also
	completes the back-compat mentioned in the previous patch - the
	only time we have an older client talking to a newer server is
	if RPC is in use, so filtering out strings during RPC prevents
	returning an unknown type to the older client.

	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x (remote_typed_param_value): Add
	another union value.
	* daemon/remote.c (remoteDeserializeTypedParameters): Handle
	strings on rpc.
	(remoteSerializeTypedParameters): Likewise; plus filter out
	strings when replying to older clients.  Adjust callers.
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c (remoteFreeTypedParameters)
	(remoteSerializeTypedParameters)
	(remoteDeserializeTypedParameters): Handle strings on rpc.
	* src/rpc/gendispatch.pl: Properly clean up typed arrays.
	* src/remote_protocol-structs: Update.
	Based on an initial patch by Hu Tao, with feedback from
	Daniel P. Berrange.

2011-11-12  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	API: add VIR_TYPED_PARAM_STRING
	This allows strings to be transported between client and server
	in the context of name-type-value virTypedParameter functions.
	For compatibility,

	    o new clients will not send strings to old servers, based on
	      a feature check
	    o new servers will not send strings to old clients without the
	      flag VIR_TYPED_PARAM_STRING_OKAY; this will be enforced at
	      the RPC layer in the next patch, so that drivers need not
	      worry about it in general.  The one exception is that
	      virDomainGetSchedulerParameters lacks a flags argument, so
	      it must not return a string; drivers that forward that
	      function on to virDomainGetSchedulerParametersFlags will
	      have to pay attention to the flag.
	    o the flag VIR_TYPED_PARAM_STRING_OKAY is set automatically,
	      based on a feature check (so far, no driver implements it),
	      so clients do not have to worry about it

	Future patches can then enable the feature on a per-driver basis.

	This patch also ensures that drivers can blindly strdup() field
	names (previously, a malicious client could stuff 80 non-NUL bytes
	into field and cause a read overrun).

	* src/libvirt_internal.h (VIR_DRV_FEATURE_TYPED_PARAM_STRING): New
	driver feature.
	* src/libvirt.c (virTypedParameterValidateSet)
	(virTypedParameterSanitizeGet): New helper functions.
	(virDomainSetMemoryParameters, virDomainSetBlkioParameters)
	(virDomainSetSchedulerParameters)
	(virDomainSetSchedulerParametersFlags)
	(virDomainGetMemoryParameters, virDomainGetBlkioParameters)
	(virDomainGetSchedulerParameters)
	(virDomainGetSchedulerParametersFlags, virDomainBlockStatsFlags):
	Use them.
	* src/util/util.h (virTypedParameterArrayClear): New helper
	function.
	* src/util/util.c (virTypedParameterArrayClear): Implement it.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms (util.h): Export it.
	Based on an initial patch by Hu Tao, with feedback from
	Daniel P. Berrange.

	qemu: fix domjobabort regression
	This reverts commit ef1065cf5ac; see also this bug report:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=751900

	In qemu 0.15.1 and earlier, during migration to file, the
	qemu_savevm_state_begin and qemu_savevm_state_iterate methods
	will both process as much migration data as possible until either

	  1. The file descriptor returns EAGAIN
	  2. The bandwidth rate limit is reached

	If we set the rate limit to ULONG_MAX, test 2 never becomes true. We're
	passing a plain file descriptor to QEMU and POSIX does not support EAGAIN on
	regular files / block devices, so test 1 never becomes true either.

	In the 'virsh save --bypass-cache' case, we pass a pipe instead of a
	regular fd, but using a pipe adds I/O overhead, so always passing a
	pipe just so qemu can see EAGAIN doesn't seem nice.

	The ultimate fix needs to come from qemu - background migration must
	respect asynchronous abort requests, or else periodically return
	control to the main handling loop without an EAGAIN and without
	waiting to hit an insanely large amount of data.  But until a
	version of qemu is fixed to support "unlimited" data rates while
	still allowing cancellation, the best we can do is avoid the
	automatic use of unlimited rates from within libvirt (users can
	still explicitly change the migration rates, if they are aware that
	they are giving up the ability to cancel a job).

	Reverting the lone use of QEMU_DOMAIN_FILE_MIG_BANDWIDTH_MAX is
	the simplest patch; this slows migration back down to a default
	32M/sec cap, but also ensures that the main qemu processing loop
	will still be responsive to cancellation requests.  Hopefully
	upstream qemu will provide us a means of safely using unlimited
	speed, including a runtime probe of that capability.

	* src/qemu/qemu_migration.c (qemuMigrationToFile): Revert attempt
	to use unlimited migration bandwidth when migrating to file.

2011-11-12  Hu Tao  <hutao@cn.fujitsu.com>

	fix two bugs in bridge_driver.c
	steps to reproduce:

	1. having a network xml file(named default.xml) like this one:

	<network>
	  <name>default</name>
	  <uuid>c5322c4c-81d0-4985-a363-ad6389780d89</uuid>
	  <bridge name="virbr0" />
	  <forward/>
	  <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
	    <dhcp>
	      <range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254" />
	    </dhcp>
	  </ip>
	</network>

	in /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/, and mark it as autostart:

	$ ls -l /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/autostart
	total 0
	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 14 Oct 12 14:02 default.xml -> ../default.xml

	2. start libvirtd and the device virbr0 is not automatically up.

	The reason is that the function virNetDevExists is now returns 1 if
	the device exists, comparing to the former one returns 0 if the device
	exists. But with only this fix will cause a segmentation fault(the same
	steps as above)  that is fixed by the second chunk of code.

2011-11-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make all brXXX APIs raise errors, instead of returning errnos
	Currently every caller of the brXXX APIs has to store the returned
	errno value and then raise an error message. This results in
	inconsistent error messages across drivers, additional burden on
	the callers and makes the error reporting inaccurate since it is
	hard to distinguish different scenarios from 1 errno value.

	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/network/bridge_driver.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_command.c, src/uml/uml_conf.c,

2011-11-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove 'brControl' object
	The bridge management APIs in src/util/bridge.c require a brControl
	object to be passed around. This holds the file descriptor for the
	control socket. This extra object complicates use of the API for
	only a minor efficiency gain, which is in turn entirely offset by
	the need to fork/exec the brctl command for STP configuration.

	This patch removes the 'brControl' object entirely, instead opening
	the control socket & closing it again within the scope of each method.

	The parameter names for the APIs are also made to consistently use
	'brname' for bridge device name, and 'ifname' for an interface
	device name. Finally annotations are added for non-NULL parameters
	and return check validation

	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h: Remove brControl object
	  and update API parameter names & annotations.

	build: allow for local gnulib diffs
	Commit f7bd00c12 pulled in a gnulib module that fails to compile
	on mingw.  While it would be nice to pull in a newer version of
	.gnulib that fixes this, it is difficult to backport any .gnulib
	update to older releases.  So, it makes sense to take advantage
	of gnulib-tool's ability to support local diffs, where we can
	apply specific diffs in our use of gnulib without waiting for
	upstream gnulib to pick up those changes, as well as avoiding
	a wholesale .gnulib update.  The existence of local diffs will
	also make it easier to backport fixes against a tarball (as long
	as a tarball and libvirt.git share the same .gnulib commit, then
	the tarball can be patched by applying the same local diffs as
	a post-release libvirt.git commit, without having to rerun an
	entire gnulib-tool bootstrap).

	This patch introduces the framework for supporting local diffs,
	without actually introducing any.

	* bootstrap.conf (local_gl_dir): New variable.
	* autogen.sh (bootstrap_hash): Hash any local diffs, to force a
	re-bootstrap if just diffs change.
	* cfg.mk (_update_required): Likewise.

	build: fix build on platforms without ptsname_r
	MacOS lacks ptsname_r, and gnulib doesn't (yet) provide it.
	But we can avoid it altogether, by using gnulib openpty()
	instead.  Note that we do _not_ want the pt_chown module;
	gnulib uses it only to implement a replacement openpty() if
	the system lacks both openpty() and granpt(), but all
	systems that we currently port to either have at least one of
	openpty() and/or grantpt(), or lack ptys altogether.  That is,
	we aren't porting to any system that requires us to deal with
	the hassle of installing a setuid pt_chown helper just to use
	gnulib's ability to provide openpty() on obscure platforms.

	* .gnulib: Update to latest, for openpty fixes
	* bootstrap.conf (gnulib_modules): Add openpty, ttyname_r.

	Fix sending/receiving of FDs when stream returns EAGAIN
	The code calling sendfd/recvfd was mistakenly assuming those
	calls would never block. They can in fact return EAGAIN and
	this is causing us to drop the client connection when blocking
	ocurrs while sending/receiving FDs.

	Fixing this is a little hairy on the incoming side, since at
	the point where we see the EAGAIN, we already thought we had
	finished receiving all data for the packet. So we play a little
	trick to reset bufferOffset again and go back into polling for
	more data.

	Add support for multiple consoles in LXC
	Currently the LXC controller only supports setup of a single
	text console. This is wired up to the container init's stdio,
	as well as /dev/console and /dev/tty1. Extending support for
	multiple consoles, means wiring up additional PTYs to /dev/tty2,
	/dev/tty3, etc, etc. The LXC controller is passed multiple open
	file handles, one for each console requested.

2011-11-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rewrite LXC I/O forwarding to use main event loop
	The current I/O code for LXC uses a hand crafted event loop
	to forward I/O between the container & host app, based on
	epoll to handle EOF on PTYs. This event loop is not easily
	extensible to add more consoles, or monitor other types of
	file descriptors.

	Remove the custom event loop and replace it with a normal
	libvirt event loop. When detecting EOF on a PTY, disable
	the event watch on that FD, and fork off a background thread
	that does a edge-triggered epoll() on the FD. When the FD
	finally shows new incoming data, the thread re-enables the
	watch on the FD and exits.

	When getting EOF from a read() on the PTY, the existing code
	would do waitpid(WNOHANG) to see if the container had exited.
	Unfortunately there is a race condition, because even though
	the process has closed its stdio handles, it might still
	exist.

	To deal with this the new event loop uses a SIG_CHILD handler
	to perform the waitpid only when the container is known to
	have actually exited.

	* src/lxc/lxc_controller.c: Rewrite the event loop to use
	  the standard APIs.

	qemu: allow getting < max typed parameters
	Since all virTypedParameter APIs allow us to return the number

	Making this change will make it easier for a future patch to

	virDomainBlockStatsFlags was missing a check that was present in
	virDomainGetMemoryParameters.  Additionally, I found that the
	existing descriptions were a bit hard to read.  A later patch
	will fix qemu to return fewer than max parameters if @nparams
	was too small on input.

	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainGetMemoryParameters)
	(virDomainGetBlkioParameters, virDomainGetSchedulerParameters)
	(virDomainGetSchedulerParametersFlags):
	Tweak documentation wording.
	(virDomainBlockStatsFlags): Likewise, and add sanity check.

	Add support for probing filesystem with libblkid
	The LXC code for mounting container filesystems from block devices
	tries all filesystems in /etc/filesystems and possibly those in
	/proc/filesystems. The regular mount binary, however, first tries
	using libblkid to detect the format. Add support for doing the same
	in libvirt, since Fedora's /etc/filesystems is missing many formats,
	most notably ext4 which is the default filesystem Fedora uses!

	Fix error message when failing to detect filesystem
	If we looped through /etc/filesystems trying to mount with each

	  the filesystems. Also fix existing error message

	Workaround for broken kernel autofs mounts
	The kernel automounter is mostly broken wrt to containers. Most
	notably if you start a new filesystem namespace and then attempt
	to unmount any autofs filesystem, it will typically fail with a
	weird error message like

	  Failed to unmount '/.oldroot/sys/kernel/security':Too many levels of symbolic links

	Attempting to detach the autofs mount using umount2(MNT_DETACH)
	will also fail with the same error. Therefore if we get any error on
	unmount()ing a filesystem from the old root FS when starting a
	container, we must immediately break out and detach the entire
	old root filesystem (ignoring any mounts below it).

	This has the effect of making the old root filesystem inaccessible
	to anything inside the container, but at the cost that the mounts
	live on in the kernel until the container exits. Given that SystemD
	uses autofs by default, we need LXC to be robust this scenario and
	thus this tradeoff is worthwhile.

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c: Detach root filesystem if any umount
	  operation fails.

	Correctly handle '*' in /etc/filesystems
	The /etc/filesystems file can contain a '*' on the last line to
	indicate that /proc/filessystems should be tried next. We have
	a check that this '*' only occurs on the last line. Unfortunately
	when we then start reading /proc/filesystems, we mistakenly think
	we've seen '*' in /proc/filesystems and fail

	  /proc/filesystems

	esx: Support folders in the path of vpx:// connection URIs
	Allow the datacenter and compute resource parts of the path
	to be prefixed with folders. Therefore, the way the path is
	parsed has changed. Before, it was split in 2 or 3 items and
	the items' meanings were determined by their positions. Now
	the path can have 2 or more items and the the vCenter server
	is asked whether a folder, datacenter of compute resource
	with the specified name exists at the current hierarchy level.

	Before the datacenter and compute resource lookup automatically
	traversed folders during lookup. This is logic got removed
	and folders have to be specified explicitly.

	The proper datacenter path including folders is now used when
	accessing a datastore over HTTPS. This makes virsh dumpxml
	and define work for datacenters in folders.

	ServerClient: Flush cached data
	If daemon is using SASL it reads client data into a cache. This cache is
	big (usually 65KB) and can thus contain 2 or more messages. However,
	on socket event we can dispatch only one message. So if we read two
	messages at once, the second will not be dispatched as the socket event
	goes away with filling the cache.
	Moreover, when dispatching the cache we need to remember to take care
	of client max requests limit.

	qemu: Restore the original states of PCI device when restarting daemon
	To support "managed" mode of host PCI device, we record the original
	states (unbind_from_stub, remove_slot, and reprobe) so that could
	reattach the device to host with original driver. But there is no XML
	for theses attrs, and thus after daemon is restarted, we lose the
	original states. It's easy to reproduce:

	    1) virsh start domain
	    2) virsh attach-device dom hostpci.xml (in 'managed' mode)
	    3) service libvirtd restart
	    4) virsh destroy domain

	    You will see the device won't be bound to the original driver
	if there was one.

	This patch is to solve the problem by introducing internal XML
	(won't be dumped to user, only dumped to status XML). The XML is:
	    <origstates>
	      <unbind/>
	      <remove_slot/>
	      <reprobe/>
	    </origstates>

	Which will be child node of <hostdev><source>...</souce></hostdev>.
	(only for PCI device).

	A new struct "virDomainHostdevOrigStates" is introduced for the XML,
	and the according members are updated when preparing the PCI device.
	And function "qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs" is modified to honor
	the original states. Use of qemuGetPciHostDeviceList is removed
	in function "qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs", and the "managed" value of
	the device config is honored by the change. This fixes another problem
	alongside:

	    qemuGetPciHostDeviceList set the device as "managed" force
	    regardless of whether the device is configured as "managed='yes'"
	    or not in XML, which is not right.

	xenapi: Improve error reporting in xenapiOpen once again
	privP->session->error_description is a list and in order to get the
	complete error message all parts of the list should be concatenated.
	xenapiSessionErrorHandler does this when its third parameter is NULL.
	The current code discards all but the first part of the error message
	resulting in a potentially incomplete error message.

	This partly reverts 006be75ee214f9b4, that tried to avoid reporting
	a (null) in the error message. The actual problem is more general in
	returnErrorFromSession that might return NULL if there is no error.

	Make sure that returnErrorFromSession return non-NULL always. Also
	don't skip the last error message part.

	Use virXMLSaveFile when writing XML config

	Introduce virXMLSaveFile as a wrapper for virFileRewrite
	Every time we write XML into a file we call virEmitXMLWarning to write a
	warning that the file is automatically generated. virXMLSaveFile
	simplifies this into a single step and makes rewriting existing XML file
	safe by using virFileRewrite internally.

	Introduce virFileRewrite for safe file rewrite
	When saving config files we just overwrite old content of the file. In
	case something fails during that process (e.g. disk gets full) we lose
	both old and new content. This patch makes the process more robust by
	writing the new content into a separate file and only if that succeeds
	the original file is atomically replaced with the new one.

	util: Add virFileAccessibleAs to private symbols
	Commit 458b7099b2e791b58f1286002974927d3e8bcc80 introduced this
	function. However it was not added into libvirt_private.syms so
	the compilation may not succeed on some hosts.

	startupPolicy: Emit event on disk source dropping
	If a disk source gets dropped because it is not accessible,
	mgmt application might want to be informed about this. Therefore
	we need to emit an event. The event presented in this patch
	is however a bit superset of what written above. The reason is simple:
	an intention to be easily expanded, e.g. on 'user ejected disk
	in guest' events. Therefore, callback gets source string and disk alias
	(which should be unique among a domain) and reason (an integer);

	qemu: implement startupPolicy
	This patch implements on_missing feature in qemu driver.
	Upon qemu startup process an accessibility of CDROMs
	and floppy disks is checked. The source might get dropped
	if unavailable and on_missing is set accordingly.
	No event is emit thought. Look for follow up patch.

	qemu: Move device alias assigning before command line construction
	This patch is rather cosmetic as it only moves device alias
	assignation from command line construction just before that.
	However, it is needed in connotation of previous and next patch.

	util: Create virFileAccessibleAs function
	This function checks if a given path is accessible under
	given uid and gid.

2011-10-25  Michal Privoznik  <mprivozn@redhat.com>

	conf: Introduce optional startupPolicy attribute for cdrom and floppy
	This attribute says what to do with cdrom (or floppy) if
	the source is missing. It accepts:
	- mandatory - fail if missing for any reason (the default)
	- requisite - fail if missing on boot up, drop if missing on
	              migrate/restore/revert
	- optional  - drop if missing at any start attempt.

	However, this patch introduces only XML part of this new
	functionality.

	virbuf: more detailed error reporting
	The next patch wants to add some sanity checking, which would
	be a different error than ENOMEM.  Many existing callers blindly
	report OOM failure if virBuf reports an error, and this will be
	wrong in the (unlikely) case that they actually had a usage error
	instead; but since the most common error really is ENOMEM, I'm

	Add test cases for parsing the qemu-name-space.
	This is based on qemuxml2argv{test,data/}, but can not reside in
	qemuxml2argv{test,data/} because ...

	1. qemuxmlns-qemu-ns-domain.xml is not schema-valid and breaks
	domainschematest. The test is still important to detect xmlns:qemu
	bindings to a name-space other than
	http://libvirt.org/schemas/domain/qemu/1.0

	2. they break qemuxml2xml, because the xmlns:qemu binding is moved to

	qemu: Fix name-space handling
	The XML parser for the qemu specific extensions expects the qemu name-space
	to be bound to the 'qemu' prefix. This is too strict, since the name of the

	URI is relevant.
	<domain>...

	qemu: Honor the orginal PCI dev properties when reattaching
	BZ# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=736214

	The problem is caused by the original info of domain's PCI dev is
	maintained by qemu_driver->activePciHostdevs list, (E.g. dev->reprobe,
	which stands for whether need to reprobe driver for the dev when do
	reattachment). The fields (dev->reprobe, dev->unbind_from_stub, and
	dev->remove_slot) are initialized properly when preparing the PCI
	device for managed attachment. However, when do reattachment, it
	construct a complete new "pciDevice" without honoring the original
	dev info, and thus the dev won't get the original driver or can get
	other problem.

	This patch is to fix the problem by get the devs from list
	driver->activePciHostdevs.

	Tested with following 3 scenarios:
	  * the PCI was bound to some driver not pci-stub before attaching

	    result: the device will be bound to the original driver

	  * the PCI was bound to pci-stub before attaching

	    result: no driver reprobing, and still bound to pci-stub

	  * The PCI was not bound to any driver

	    result: no driver reprobing, and still not bound to any driver.

	A few people have attempted to use the new forwarding modes with older

	always stated the minimum required libvirt version, but the examples
	at the end didn't, which I believe is what has caused the confusion.

	Similarly, the section on portgroups now has a version tag added at
	the beginning.

	I also noticed that there was no example of defining a <dns> hostname,
	so I added one, as well as making the domain name example more
	recognizable (by adding ".com" to the domain).

	qemu: Do not reattach PCI device used by other domain when shutdown
	When failing on starting a domain, it tries to reattach all the PCI
	devices defined in the domain conf, regardless of whether the devices
	are still used by other domain. This will cause the devices to be deleted
	from the list qemu_driver->activePciHostdevs, thus the devices will be
	thought as usable even if it's not true. And following commands
	nodedev-{reattach,reset} will be successful.

	How to reproduce:
	  1) Define two domains with same PCI device defined in the confs.
	  2) # virsh start domain1
	  3) # virsh start domain2
	  4) # virsh nodedev-reattach $pci_device

	You will see the device will be reattached to host successfully.
	As pciDeviceReattach just check if the device is still used by
	other domain via checking if the device is in list driver->activePciHostdevs,
	however, the device is deleted from the list by step 2).

	This patch is to prohibit the bug by:
	  1) Prohibit a domain starting or device attachment right at
	     preparation period (qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevices) if the
	     device is in list driver->activePciHostdevs, which means
	     it's used by other domain.

	  2) Introduces a new field for struct _pciDevice, (const char *used_by),
	     it will be set as the domain name at preparation period,
	     (qemuPrepareHostdevPCIDevices). Thus we can prohibit deleting
	     the device from driver->activePciHostdevs if it's still used by
	     other domain when stopping the domain process.

	* src/pci.h (define two internal functions, pciDeviceSetUsedBy and
	    pciDevceGetUsedBy)
	* src/pci.c (new field "const char *used_by" for struct _pciDevice,
	    implementations for the two new functions)

	    device from activePciHostdevs list if it's still used by other domain)
	* src/qemu_hotplug.c (Update function usage, as the definitions are

	loses the original order. When the domain is then re-defined, the order
	of disks is changed, which breaks PyGrub, since a different disk gets
	passed.

	When converting xen-sxpr to libvirt-xml, use the "bootable"-flag to
	determine the first disk.

	This isn't perfect, since several disks can be marked as bootable using
	the Xend-API, but that is not supported by libvirt. In all known cases
	relevant to libvirt exactly one disk is marked as bootable.

	Introduce <driver> under <filesystem> to support open-by-handle
	VirtFS allows the user to choose between path/handle based fs driver.
	As of now, libvirt hardcoded path based driver only. This patch provides

	      <driver type='handle'/>
	      <source dir='/folder/to/share1'/>
	      <target dir='mount_tag1'/>

	daemon: Always advertise libvirtd service
	This is a regression introduced by new RPC codes, previously
	we advertise the service via ssh even if the daemon doesn't
	listen on TLS port (TCP is not choosed). Now the service is

	snapshot: framework for more efficient relation traversal
	No one was using virDomainSnapshotHasChildren, but that was an
	O(n) function.  Exposing and tracking a bit more metadata for each
	snapshot will allow the same query to be made with an O(1) query
	of the member field.  For single snapshot operations (create,
	delete), callers can be trusted to maintain the metadata themselves,
	but for reloading, we can't compute parents as we go since there
	is no guarantee that parents were parsed before children, so we also
	provide a function to refresh the relationships, and which can
	be used to detect if the user has ignored our warnings and been
	directly modifying files in /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/snapshot.  This
	patch only adds metadata; later patches will actually use it.

	This layout intentionally hardcodes the size of each snapshot struct,
	by tracking sibling pointers, rather than having to deal with the
	headache of yet more memory management by directly sticking a
	dynamically sized child[] on each parent.

	snapshot: virsh shorthand for operating on current snap
	Rather than having to do:

	$ virsh snapshot-revert dom $(virsh snapshot-current dom --name)

	I thought it would be nice to do:

	$ virsh snapshot-revert dom --current

	I didn't add 'virsh snapshot-dumpxml --current' since we already have
	'virsh snapshot-current' for the same task.  snapshot-list accepted
	a name but did not require it, and that remains the case, with
	--current serving in place of that name.  For all other commands,
	name used to be required, and can now be replaced by --current;
	I intentionally made it so that omitting both --current and a name
	is an error (having the absence of a name imply --current seems
	just a bit too magic, so --current must be explicit).  I also had
	to keep snapshot-edit backwards-compatible, as the only command
	that already had a --current argument alongside a name, which still
	works to both edit a named snapshot and make it current.

	build: fix 'make check' linkage with dtrace
	Building on Linux with dtrace enabled was failing 'make check':

	  CCLD   nodeinfotest
	../src/.libs/libvirt_test.a(libvirt_net_rpc_client_la-virnetclient.o): In function `virNetClientNew':
	/home/remote/eblake/libvirt/src/rpc/virnetclient.c:162: undefined reference to `libvirt_rpc_client_new_semaphore'

	On looking further, I see some earlier warnings emitted from libtool:

	*** Warning: Linking the shared library libvirt.la against the non-libtool
	*** objects  probes.o is not portable!

	Since src/probes.o is only built on Linux, and even then, only when
	dtrace is enabled, this failure does not affect other platforms, and
	despite libtool warning that it is not generally portable, it is not
	a problem for our use-case in libvirt.la.  But it turns out that while
	libtool is willing to jam raw .o files into an installed shared
	library (libvirt.la becomes libvirt.so), it is NOT willing to jam
	the same .o file into the convenience library libvirt_test.la.
	Perhaps this is a bug in libtool, but even if we get libtool fixed,
	libvirt must continue to build on platforms with older libtool.  So,
	the fix is the same as we are already using for the libvirt_lxc
	executable - don't rely on the .o file being in the convenience
	library, but instead use LDADD to pull it in directly.

	Rewrite all the DTrace/SystemTAP probing
	The libvirtd daemon had a few crude system tap probes. Some of
	these were broken during the RPC rewrite. The new modular RPC
	code is structured in a way that allows much more effective
	tracing. Instead of trying to hook up the original probes,
	define a new set of probes for the RPC and event code.

	The master probes file is now src/probes.d.  This contains
	probes for virNetServerClientPtr, virNetClientPtr, virSocketPtr
	virNetTLSContextPtr and virNetTLSSessionPtr modules. Also add
	probes for the poll event loop.

	The src/dtrace2systemtap.pl script can convert the probes.d
	file into a libvirt_probes.stp file to make use from systemtap
	much simpler.

	The src/rpc/gensystemtap.pl script can generate a set of
	systemtap functions for translating RPC enum values into
	printable strings. This works for all RPC header enums (program,
	type, status, procedure) and also the authentication enum

	The PROBE macro will automatically generate a VIR_DEBUG
	statement, so any place with a PROBE can remove any existing
	manual DEBUG statements.

	snapshot: avoid accidental renames with snapshot-edit
	I was a bit surprised that 'virsh snapshot-edit dom name' silently
	allowed me to clone things, while still telling me the old name,
	especially since other commands like 'virsh edit dom' reject rename
	attempts (*).  This fixes things to be more explicit (**).

	(*) Technically, 'virsh edit dom' relies on virDomainDefineXML
	behavior, which rejects attempts to mix a new name with existing
	uuid or new uuid with existing name, but you can create a new
	domain by changing both uuid and name.  On the other hand, while
	snapshot-edit --clone is a true clone, creating a new domain
	would also have to decide whether to clone snapshot metadata,
	managed save, and any other secondary data related to the domain.
	Domain renames are not trivial either.

	(**) Renaming or creating a clone is still a risky proposition -
	for offline snapshots and system checkpoints, if the new name
	does not match an actual name recorded in the qcow2 internal
	snapshots, then you cannot revert to the new checkpoint.  But it
	is assumed that anyone using the new virsh flags knows what they
	are doing, and can deal with the fallout caused by a rename/clone;
	that is, we can't completely prevent a user from shooting
	themselves in the foot, so much as we are making the default
	action less risky.

	storage: Do not use comma as seperator for lvs output
	* src/storage/storage_backend_logical.c:

	If a logical vol is created as striped. (e.g. --stripes 3),
	the "device" field of lvs output will have multiple fileds which are
	seperated by comma. Thus the RE we write in the codes will not
	work well anymore. E.g. (lvs output for a stripped vol, uses "#" as
	seperator here):

	test_stripes##fSLSZH-zAS2-yAIb-n4mV-Al9u-HA3V-oo9K1B#\
	/dev/sdc1(10240),/dev/sdd1(0)#42949672960#4194304

	The RE we use:

	    const char *regexes[] = {
	        "^\\s*(\\S+),(\\S*),(\\S+),(\\S+)\\((\\S+)\\),(\\S+),([0-9]+),?\\s*$"
	    };

	Also the RE doesn't match the "devices" field of striped vol properly,
	it contains multiple "device path" and "offset".

	This patch mainly does:
	    1) Change the seperator into "#"
	    2) Change the RE for "devices" field from "(\\S+)\\((\\S+)\\)"
	       into "(\\S+)".
	    3) Add two new options for lvs command, (segtype, stripes)
	    4) Extend the RE to match the value for the two new fields.

2011-10-07  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: add separate rerror_policy for disk errors
	Previously libvirt's disk device XML only had a single attribute,
	error_policy, to control both read and write error policy, but qemu
	has separate options for controlling read and write. In one case
	(enospc) a policy is allowed for write errors but not read errors.

	This patch adds a separate attribute that sets only the read error
	policy. If just error_policy is set, it will apply to both read and
	write error policy (previous behavior), but if the new rerror_policy
	attribute is set, it will override error_policy for read errors only.
	Possible values for rerror_policy are "stop", "report", and "ignore"
	("report" is the qemu-controlled default for rerror_policy when
	error_policy isn't specified).

	For consistency, the value "report" has been added to the possible
	values for error_policy as well.

2011-10-07  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: leave rerror policy at default when enospace is requested
	commit 12062ab set rerror=ignore when error_policy="enospace" was
	selected (since the rerror option in qemu doesn't accept "enospc", as
	the werror option does).

	After that patch was already pushed, Paolo Bonzini noticed it and
	commented that leaving rerror at the default ("report") would be a
	better choice. This patch corrects the problem - if error_policy =
	"enospace" is given, rerror is left off the qemu commandline,
	effectively setting it to "report". For other values, rerror is still
	set to match werror.

	Additionally, the parsing of error_policy was changed to no longer
	erroneously allow "default" as a choice - as with most other
	attributes, if you want the default setting, just don't specify an
	error_policy.

	Finally, two ommissions in the first patch were corrected - a
	long-dormant qemuxml2argv test for enospace was enabled, and fixed to
	pass, and the argv2xml parser in qemu_command.c was updated to
	recognize the different spelling on the qemu commandline.

	qemu: enable multifunction for older qemu
	Now that RHEL 6.2 Beta is out, it would be nice to test multifunction

	for qemu 0.13 which lacked a -device query), and by -device query
	(provided by qemu.git and backported to the RHEL beta build of

	init: raise default system aio limits
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740899 documents that
	if qemu uses aio=native for its disks, then it consumes 128 aio
	requests per disk.  On a host with multiple guests, this can quickly
	run out of kernel aio requests with the default aio-max-nr of
	65536.  Kernel developers have confirmed that there is no up-front
	cost to raising this limit (a larger limit merely implies that more
	aio requests can be issued in parallel, which in turn will result
	in more kernel memory allocation, only if the system really does use
	that many requests).  Since the system default limit prevents 256
	disks, which is well within libvirt's current scalability, this
	patch installs a file to raise the limit and document it in case a
	system administrator has further cause to tune the limit.  The
	install only works on platforms new enough to source /etc/sysctl.d/*
	alongside /etc/sysctl.conf (F14 and RHEL 6).

	connectivity to the domain) can come into play.  Requiring extra
	acknowledgment in these cases will make it less likely that

	Also create a new error code, so users can distinguish when forcing
	would make a difference, rather than having to blindly request force.

	snapshot: implement snapshot roots listing in vbox
	Commit 9f5e53e introduced the ability to filter snapshots to

	The VBox implementation prohibits deletion of a snapshot with
	multiple children.  Hence, there can only be at most one root,
	which is found by searching for the snapshot with a NULL uuid.

	qemu: correct misspelled 'enospc' option, and only use for werror
	This resolves:

	     https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=730909

	When support for setting the qemu disk error policy to "enospc" was
	added, it was inadvertently spelled "enospace". This patch corrects
	that on the qemu commandline (while retaining the "enospace" spelling
	for libvirt's XML).

	Also, while examining the qemu source, I found that "enospc" is not
	allowed for the read error policy, only for write error policy (makes
	sense). Since libvirt currently only has a single error policy
	setting, when "enospace" is selected, the read error policy is set to
	"ignore".

	snapshot: better virsh handling of missing current, parent
	Previously, virsh 'snapshot-parent' and 'snapshot-current' were
	completely silent in the case where the code conclusively proved
	there was no parent or current snapshot, but differed in exit
	status; this silence caused some confusion on whether the commands
	worked.  Furthermore, commit d1be48f introduced a regression where
	snapshot-parent would leak output about an unknown function, but
	only on the first attempt, when talking to an older server that
	lacks virDomainSnapshotGetParent.  This changes things to consistenly
	report an error message and exit with status 1 when no snapshot
	exists, and to avoid leaking unknown function warnings when using
	fallbacks.

	* tools/virsh.c (vshGetSnapshotParent): Alter signature, to
	distinguish between real error and missing parent.  Don't pollute

	Allow passing of command line args to LXC container
	When booting a virtual machine with a kernel/initrd it is possible

	element in the guest XML. These appear to the kernel / init process
	in /proc/cmdline.

	When booting a container we do not have a custom /proc/cmdline,
	but we can easily set an environment variable for it. Ideally
	we could pass individual arguments to the init process as a

	network: fill in bandwidth from portgroup for all forward modes
	This patch is a fix for:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=743176

	which was discovered by Dan Berrange while making bandwidth
	configuration work for LXC guests.

	Background: Although virtportprofile data from a network portgroup is
	only applicable for direct mode interfaces, the code that copies
	bandwidth data from the portgroup was also only being executed in the
	case of direct mode interfaces. The result was that interfaces using
	traditional virtual networks (forward mode='nat|route|none'), and
	those using a host bridge for forwarding, would not pick up bandwidth
	data from a portgroup defined in the network.

	This patch moves that code outside the conditional, so that bandwidth
	information is *alway* copied from the appropriate portgroup (unless
	the <interface> definition itself already has bandwidth information,
	which would take precedence over what's in the portgroup anyway).

	qemu: make PCI multifunction support more manual
	When support for was added for PCI multifunction cards (in commit
	9f8baf, first included in libvirt 0.9.3), it was done by always
	turning on the multifunction bit for all PCI devices. Since that time
	it has been realized that this is not an ideal solution, and that the
	multifunction bit must be selectively turned on. For example, see

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=728174

	and the discussion before and after

	  https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2011-September/msg01036.html

	This patch modifies multifunction support so that the multifunction=on
	option is only added to the qemu commandline for a device if its PCI
	<address> definition has the attribute "multifunction='on'", e.g.:

	  <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00'
	           slot='0x04' function='0x0' multifunction='on'/>

	In practice, the multifunction bit should only be turned on if
	function='0' AND other functions will be used in the same slot - it
	usually isn't needed for functions 1-7 (although there are apparently
	some exceptions, e.g. the Intel X53 according to the QEMU source
	code), and should never be set if only function 0 will be used in the
	slot. The test cases have been changed accordingly to illustrate.

	With this patch in place, if a user attempts to assign multiple
	functions in a slot without setting the multifunction bit for function
	0, libvirt will issue an error when the domain is defined, and the
	define operation will fail. In the future, we may decide to detect
	this situation and automatically add multifunction=on to avoid the
	error; even then it will still be useful to have a manual method of
	turning on multifunction since, as stated above, there are some
	devices that excpect it to be turned on for all functions in a slot.

	A side effect of this patch is that attempts to use the same PCI
	address for two different devices will now log an error (previously
	this would cause the domain define operation to fail, but there would
	be no log message generated). Because the function doing this log was
	almost completely rewritten, I didn't think it worthwhile to make a
	separate patch for that fix (the entire patch would immediately be
	obsoleted).

	lvm storage backend: handle command_names=1 in lvm.conf
	If the regexes supported (?:pvs)?, then we could handle this by
	optionally matching but not returning the initial command name.  But it
	doesn't.  So add a new char* argument to
	virStorageBackendRunProgRegex().  If that argument is NULL then we act
	as usual.  Otherwise, if the string at that argument is found at the
	start of a returned line, we drop that before running the regex.

	With this patch, virt-manager shows me lvs with command_names 1 or 0.

	The definitions of PVS_BASE etc may want to be moved into the configure
	scripts (though given how PVS is found, IIUC that could only happen if
	pvs was a link to pvs_real), but in any case no sense dealing with that
	until we're sure this is an ok way to handle it.

	security: properly chown/label bidirectional and unidirectional fifos
	This patch fixes the regression with using named pipes for qemu serial
	devices noted in:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=740478

	The problem was that, while new code in libvirt looks for a single
	bidirectional fifo of the name given in the config, then relabels that
	and continues without looking for / relabelling the two unidirectional
	fifos named ${name}.in and ${name}.out, qemu looks in the opposite
	order. So if the user had naively created all three fifos, libvirt
	would relabel the bidirectional fifo to allow qemu access, but qemu
	would attempt to use the two unidirectional fifos and fail (because it
	didn't have proper permissions/rights).

	This patch changes the order that libvirt looks for the fifos to match
	what qemu does - first it looks for the dual fifos, then it looks for
	the single bidirectional fifo. If it finds the dual unidirectional
	fifos first, it labels/chowns them and ignores any possible
	bidirectional fifo.

	(Note commit d37c6a3a (which first appeared in libvirt-0.9.2) added
	the code that checked for a bidirectional fifo. Prior to that commit,
	bidirectional fifos for serial devices didn't work because libvirt
	always required the ${name}.(in|out) fifos to exist, and qemu would
	always prefer those.

	qemu: Preserve fakeReboot flag in domain status
	Thus, when libvirtd is restarted, it will know if a domain is supposed
	to be killed or reset when it shuts down.

	qemu: Finish domain shutdown on reconnect
	If a domain started with -no-shutdown shuts down while libvirtd is not
	running, it will be seen as paused when libvirtd reconnects to it. Use
	the paused reason to detect if a domain was stopped because of shutdown
	and finish the process just as if a SHUTDOWN event is delivered from
	qemu.

	qemu: Check domain status details when reconnecting monitor
	Current qemu is able to give us detailed domain status (not just if it
	is running or not) which we can translate into a status reason.

	If migration failed in Prepare phase after virDomainAssignDef and before

	qemu: add ability to set PCI device "rombar" on or off
	This patch was made in response to:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=738095

	In short, qemu's default for the rombar setting (which makes the
	firmware ROM of a PCI device visible/not on the guest) was previously
	0 (not visible), but they recently changed the default to 1
	(visible). Unfortunately, there are some PCI devices that fail in the
	guest when rombar is 1, so the setting must be exposed in libvirt to
	prevent a regression in behavior (it will still require explicitly
	setting <rom bar='off'/> in the guest XML).

	rombar is forced on/off by adding:

	  <rom bar='on|off'/>

	inside a <hostdev> element that defines a PCI device. It is currently
	ignored for all other types of devices.

	At the moment there is no clean method to determine whether or not the
	rombar option is supported by QEMU - this patch uses the advice of a
	QEMU developer to assume support for qemu-0.12+. There is currently a
	patch in the works to put this information in the output of "qemu-kvm
	-device pci-assign,?", but of course if we switch to keying off that,
	we would lose support for setting rombar on all the versions of qemu
	between 0.12 and whatever version gets that patch.

	qemu: Relax -no-shutdown check to [0.14.0, 0.15.50)
	SIGTERM handling for -no-shutdown is already fixed in qemu git and
	libvirt can safely use it. The downside is that 0.15.50 version of qemu
	can be any qemu compiled from git, even that without the fix for
	SIGTERM. However, I think this patch is worth it since excluding 0.15.50
	from the check makes testing current qemu with libvirt much easier and
	someone running qemu from git should be able to rebuild fixed qemu from
	git if they hit the problem with a hang on shutdown.

	storage: Wait udev events are handled before removing lvm vol
	Related #BZ: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702260.

	There are two problems described in the BZ:
	1) "Can't remove open logical volume".
	2) "Unable to deactivate logical volume "foo""

	This patch just intends to fix 2), as 1) is expected if the vol
	is still used by something, and you never known if "lvchange -an"
	will fail or not either (sometime, it will succeed, sometimes not).
	We'd better not look for trouble, :-)

	For 2), that's caused by race between lvremove and udev event handling,
	the only workable way now is to wait the events handling are finished,
	though it might introduce latencies, as "udevadmin settle" exits
	after *all* events are handled, it's the only way we can fix
	the racing in libvirt layer.

	See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=570359 for more
	details.

	qemu: Avoid loop of fake reboots
	Once virDomainReboot is called for a domain, guest OS initiated shutdown
	would always result in reboot instead of shutdown. Only
	virDomainShutdown would actually shutd such domain down. That's because
	we forgot to reset fakeReboot flag once we asked the domain to reboot.

	qemu: Fix shutdown regression with buggy qemu
	The commit that prevents disk corruption on domain shutdown
	(96fc4784177ecb70357518fa863442455e45ad0e) causes regression with QEMU
	0.14.* and 0.15.* because of a regression bug in QEMU that was fixed
	only recently in QEMU git. The affected versions of QEMU do not quit on
	SIGTERM if started with -no-shutdown, which we use to implement fake
	reboot. Since -no-shutdown tells QEMU not to quit automatically on guest
	shutdown, domains started using the affected QEMU cannot be shutdown
	properly and stay in a paused state.

	This patch disables fake reboot feature on such QEMU by not using
	-no-shutdown, which makes shutdown work as expected. However,
	virDomainReboot will not work in this case and it will report "Requested
	operation is not valid: Reboot is not supported with this QEMU binary".

	Update to require sanlock 1.8 for license compliance
	Inexplicably the sanlock code all got placed under the GPLv2-only,
	so libvirt's use of sanlock introduces a license incompatibility.
	The sanlock developers have now rearranged the code such that there
	is a 'sanlock_client.so' which is LGPLv2+ while their daemon remains
	GPLv2-only. To use the new client library we need to call the new
	sanlock_init and sanlock_align APIs instead of sanlock_direct_init
	and sanlock_direct_align. These APIs calls are now routed via the
	sanlock daemon, instead of doing direct I/O calls to disk.

	For all this we require sanlock >= 1.8

	* configure.ac: Check for sanlock_client.so instead of sanlock.so
	  and fix various comments
	* libvirt.spec.in: Mandate sanlock >= 1.8
	* src/Makefile.am: Link to -lsanlock_client

	conf: Assign newDef of active domain as persistent conf if it is NULL
	Libvirt loads the domain conf from status XML if it's running when
	starting up. The problem is there is no record of the original conf.
	(dom->newDef is NULL here).

	So libvirt won't be able to restore the domain conf to original one
	when destroying/shutdown. E.g.

	1) attach a device without "--persistent"
	2) restart libvirtd
	3) destroy domain
	4) start domain

	One will see the the disk still exists.

	This patch is to fix the peoblem by assigning persistent domain conf
	to dom->newDef if it's NULL and the domain is running.

	snapshot: allow disk snapshots of qcow2 disks
	For all types of disks other than qcow2, we were requesting that
	SELinux labeling visit the new file as if it were qcow2, which
	means labeling would try to find the backing files of an empty file.
	And for a pre-existing qcow2 disk, we were passing NULL, which meant
	that labelling tried to probe the file type (and if probing is
	disabled, per the default qemu.conf, this made snapshots fail).
	What we really want is to make SELinux labeling visit the new
	file as raw; it will later be converted to qcow2 if qemu successfully
	made the snapshot.

	Prevent crash from dlclose() of libvirt.so
	When libvirt calls virInitialize it creates a thread local
	for the virErrorPtr storage, and registers a callback to
	cleanup memory when a thread exits. When libvirt is dlclose()d
	or otherwise made non-resident, the callback function is
	removed from memory, but the thread local may still exist
	and if a thread later exists, it will invoke the callback
	and SEGV. There may also be other thread locals with callbacks
	pointing to libvirt code, so it is in general never safe to
	unload libvirt.so from memory once initialized.

	To allow dlclose() to succeed, but keep libvirt.so resident
	in memory, link with '-z nodelete'. This issue was first
	found with the libvirt CIM provider, but can potentially
	hit many of the dynamic language bindings which all ultimately
	involve dlopen() in some way, either on libvirt.so itself,
	or on the glue code for the binding which in turns links
	to libvirt

	* configure.ac, src/Makefile.am: Ensure libvirt.so is linked
	  with -z nodelete

	qemu: Introduce shutdown reason for paused state
	Qemu sends STOP event as part of the shutdown process. Detect such STOP
	event and consider shutdown to be reason of emitting such event. That's
	the best we can do until qemu provides us the reason directly in STOP
	event. This allows us to report shutdown reason for paused state so that
	apps can detect domains that failed to finish the shutdown process
	(e.g., because qemu is buggy and doesn't exit on SIGTERM or it is
	blocked in flushing disk buffers).

2011-09-16  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	qemu: Prevent disk corruption on domain shutdown
	Ever since we introduced fake reboot, we call qemuProcessKill as a
	reaction to SHUTDOWN event. Unfortunately, qemu doesn't guarantee it
	flushed all internal buffers before sending SHUTDOWN, in which case
	killing the process forcibly may result in (virtual) disk corruption.

	By sending just SIGTERM without SIGKILL we give qemu time to to flush
	all buffers and exit. Once qemu exits, we will see an EOF on monitor
	connection and tear down the domain. In case qemu ignores SIGTERM or
	just hangs there, the process stays running but that's not any different
	from a possible hang anytime during the shutdown process so I think it's
	just fine.

	Also qemu (since 0.14 until it's fixed) has a bug in SIGTERM processing
	which causes it not to exit but instead send new SHUTDOWN event and keep
	waiting. I think the best we can do is to ignore duplicate SHUTDOWN
	events to avoid a SHUTDOWN-SIGTERM loop and leave the domain in paused
	state.

2011-09-16  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	qemu: Properly detect crash of a rebooted domain
	When a domain is rebooted using libvirt API, we use fake reboot
	consisting of shutting down and resetting the domain. Thus we see a
	SHUTDOWN event and set gotShutdown flag. But we never reset it back and
	if the domain crashes after it was rebooted this way, we consider it was
	a normal shutdown and not a crash.

	qemu: Fix shutoff reason when domain crashes
	Commit 4454a9efc728b91e791b1f14c26ea23a19d57f48 changed shutoff reason
	from VIR_DOMAIN_SHUTOFF_CRASHED to VIR_DOMAIN_SHUTOFF_FAILED in case we
	see an unexpected EOF on monitor connection. But FAILED reason is
	dedicated for domains that fail to start. CRASHED reason is the right
	one to use in this situation.

	snapshot: tweak snapshot-create-as diskspec docs
	With this patch, it is hopefully a bit more obvious that for
	snapshot-create-as, a literal '--diskspec' is mandatory if name
	or description was omitted, but optional if all earlier options
	were provided.

	These all denote two diskspecs and a description:
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name desc vda vdb
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name desc --diskspec vda --diskspec vdb
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name desc --diskspec vda vdb
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name desc vda --diskspec vdb
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom --diskspec vda --diskspec vdb name desc

	This gives two diskspecs but no description:
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name --diskspec vda --diskspec vdb

	And this treats 'vda' as the description, with only one diskspec:
	virsh snapshot-create-as dom name vda vdb

	Use max bandwidth from qemuDomainObjPrivate struct when migrating
	Adjust qemuMigrationRun() to use migMaxBandwidth in qemuDomainObjPrivate

2011-09-15  Jim Fehlig  <jfehlig@novell.com>

	Set qemu migration speed unlimited when migrating to file
	The qemu migration speed default is 32MiB/s as defined in migration.c

	/* Migration speed throttling */
	static int64_t max_throttle = (32 << 20);

	There's no need to throttle migration when targeting a file, so set migration
	speed to unlimited prior to migration, and restore to libvirt default value
	after migration.

	Default units is MB for migrate_set_speed monitor command, so
	(INT64_MAX / (1024 * 1024)) is used for unlimited migration speed.

	Tested with both json and text monitors.

	snapshot: ABI stability must include memory sizing
	Commit 973fcd8f introduced the ability for qemu to reject snapshot
	reversion on an ABI incompatibility; but the very example that was
	first proposed on-list[1] as a demonstration of an ABI incompatibility,
	namely that of changing the max memory allocation, was not being
	checked for, resulting in a cryptic failure when running with larger
	max mem than what the snapshot was created with:
	error: operation failed: Error -22 while loading VM state

	This commit merely protects the three variables within mem that are
	referenced by qemu_command.c, rather than all 7 (the other 4 variables
	affect cgroup handling, but as far as I can tell, have no visible effect
	to the qemu guest).  This also affects migration and save file handling,
	which are other places where we perform ABI compatibility checks.

	Fix URL-escaping for domainDefine
	'+' in strings get translated to ' ' when editing domains.
	While xenDaemonDomainCreateXML() did URL-escape the sexpr,
	xenDaemonDomainDefineXML() did not.

	Remove the explicit urlencode() in xenDaemonDomainCreateXML() and add
	the direct encoding calls to xend_op_ext() because it calls xend_post()
	which uses "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded". According
	to <http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.4.1> this
	requires all parameters to be url-encoded as specified in rfc1738.

	Notice: virBufferAsprintf(..., "%s=%s", ...) is again replaced by three
	calls to virBufferURIEncodeString() and virBufferAddChar() because '='
	is a "reserved" character, which would get escaped by
	virBufferURIEncodeString(), which - by the way - escapes anything not
	c_isalnum().

	xml: Change virtual file names of xml documents parsed in memory
	While parsing XML strings from memory, the previous convention in
	libvirt was to set the virtual file name to "domain.xml" or something
	similar. This could potentialy trick the user into looking for a file
	named domain.xml on the disk in an attempt to fix the error.

	This patch changes these filenames to something that can't be as easily
	confused for a valid filename.

	Don't treat pci_system_init failure as fatal if no PCI bus is present
	Xen PV domU's have no PCI bus. node_device_udev.c calls pci_system_init
	which looks for /sys/bus/pci. If it does not find /sys/bus/pci (which it
	won't in a Xen PV domU) it returns unsuccesfully (ENOENT), which libvirt
	considers fatal. This makes libvirt unusable in this environment, even

	link-state: qemu: Add net intf modification to virUpdateDeviceFlags
	This patch enables modifying network device configuration using the
	virUpdateDeviceFlags API method. Matching of devices is accomplished
	using MAC addresses.

	While updating live configuration of a running domain, the user is
	allowed only to change link state of the interface. Additional
	modifications may be added later. For now the code checks for
	unsupported changes and thereafter changes the link state, if
	applicable.

	When updating persistent configuration of guest's network interface the
	whole configuration (except for the MAC address) may be modified and
	is stored for the next startup.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c   - Add dispatching of virUpdateDevice for

	latency: Update virsh command domblkstat to use new API
	The modified function fallbacks to use virDomainBlockStats if
	virDomainBlockStatsFlags is not supported by the hypervisor driver.
	If the new API is supported, it will be invoked instead of the
	old API.

	latency: Expose the new API for Python binding

	latency: Implemente internal API for qemu driver

2011-09-06  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	latency: Update monitor functions for new latency fields
	The mainly changes are:

	1) Update qemuMonitorGetBlockStatsInfo and it's children (Text/JSON)
	   functions to return the value of new latency fields.
	2) Add new function qemuMonitorGetBlockStatsParamsNumber, which is
	   to count how many parameters the underlying QEMU supports.
	3) Update virDomainBlockStats in src/qemu/qemu_driver.c to be
	   compatible with the changes by 1).

2011-09-06  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	latency: Wire up the remote protocol

	latency: Implemente the public API

	latency: Define the internal driver callback

	latency: Define new public API and structure

	qemu: Deal with stucked qemu on daemon startup
	If libvirt daemon gets restarted and there is (at least) one
	unresponsive qemu, the startup procedure hangs up. This patch creates
	one thread per vm in which we try to reconnect to monitor. Therefore,
	blocking in one thread will not affect other APIs.

	qemu: Introduce job queue size limit
	This patch creates an optional BeginJob queue size limit. When
	active, all other attempts above level will fail. To set this
	feature assign desired value to max_queued variable in qemu.conf.
	Setting it to 0 turns it off.

2011-09-06  Michal Privoznik  <mprivozn@redhat.com>

	daemon: Create priority workers pool
	This patch annotates APIs with low or high priority.
	In low set MUST be all APIs which might eventually access monitor
	(and thus block indefinitely). Other APIs may be marked as high
	priority. However, some must be (e.g. domainDestroy).

	For high priority calls (HPC), there are some high priority workers
	(HPW) created in the pool. HPW can execute only HPC, although normal
	worker can process any call regardless priority. Therefore, only those
	APIs which are guaranteed to end in reasonable small amount of time
	can be marked as HPC.

	The size of this HPC pool is static, because HPC are expected to end
	quickly, therefore jobs assigned to this pool will be served quickly.
	It can be configured in libvirtd.conf via prio_workers variable.
	Default is set to 5.

	To mark API with low or high priority, append priority:{low|high} to
	it's comment in src/remote/remote_protocol.x. This is similar to
	autogen|skipgen. If not marked, the generator assumes low as default.

	snapshot: use SELinux and lock manager with external snapshots
	With this, it is now possible to create external snapshots even
	when SELinux is enforcing, and to protect the new file with a
	lock manager.

	(qemuDomainSnapshotCreateSingleDiskActive): Create and register
	new file with proper permissions and locks.
	(qemuDomainSnapshotCreateDiskActive): Update caller.

2011-09-05  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: wire up live qemu disk snapshots
	Lots of earlier patches led up to this point - the qemu snapshot_blkdev
	monitor command can now be controlled by libvirt!  Well, insofar as
	SELinux doesn't prevent qemu from open(O_CREAT) on the files.  There's
	still some followup work before things work with SELinux enforcing,
	but this patch is big enough to post now.

	There's still room for other improvements, too (for example, taking a
	disk snapshot of an inactive domain, by using qemu-img for both internal
	and external snapshots; wiring up delete and revert control, including
	additional flags from my RFC; supporting active QED disk snapshots;
	supporting per-storage-volume snapshots such as LVM or btrfs snapshots;
	etc.).  But this patch is the one that proves the new XML works!

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Wire in
	active disk snapshots.

	snapshot: wire up new qemu monitor command
	No one uses this yet, but it will be important once

	snapshot: make it possible to audit external snapshot
	Snapshots alter the set of disk image files opened by qemu, so
	they must be audited.  But they don't involve a full disk definition
	structure, just the new filename.  Make the next patch easier by
	refactoring the audit routines to just operate on file name.

	* src/conf/domain_audit.h (virDomainAuditDisk): Update prototype.
	* src/conf/domain_audit.c (virDomainAuditDisk): Act on strings,

	snapshot: reject unimplemented disk snapshot features
	My RFC for snapshot support [1] proposes several rules for when it is
	safe to delete or revert to an external snapshot, predicated on
	the existence of new API flags.  These will be incrementally added
	in future patches, but until then, blindly mishandling a disk
	snapshot risks corrupting internal state, so it is better to
	outright reject the attempts until the other pieces are in place,
	thus incrementally relaxing the restrictions added in this patch.

	snapshot: add flag for requesting disk snapshot
	Prior to this patch, <domainsnapshot>/<disks> was ignored.  This

	snapshot: add virsh domblklist command
	This adds a convenience function to virsh that parses out block
	information from the domain xml, making it much easier to see
	what strings can be used in all other contexts that demand a
	specific block name, especially when given the previous patch
	that allows using either target or unique source name.

	As an example on a domain with one disk and an empty cdrom drive:

2011-09-05  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: also support disks by path
	I got confused when 'virsh domblkinfo dom disk' required the
	path to a disk (which can be ambiguous, since a single file
	can back multiple disks), rather than the unambiguous target
	device name that I was using in disk snapshots.  So, in true
	developer fashion, I went for the best of both worlds - all
	interfaces that operate on a disk (aka block) now accept
	either the target name or the unambiguous path to the backing
	file used by the disk.

2011-09-05  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: allow halting after snapshot
	Since a snapshot is fully recoverable, it is useful to have a
	snapshot as a means of hibernating a guest, then reverting to
	the snapshot to wake the guest up.  This mode of usage is
	similar to 'virsh save/virsh restore', except that virsh
	save uses an external file while virsh snapshot keeps the
	vm state internal to a qcow2 file.  However, it only works on
	persistent domains.

	In the usage pattern of snapshot/revert for hibernating a guest,
	there is no need to keep the guest running between the two points
	in time, especially since that would generate runtime state that
	would just be discarded.  Add a flag to make it possible to
	stop the domain after the snapshot has completed.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in (VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_HALT):
	New flag.
	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Document it.

	snapshot: expose new delete flag in virsh
	It would technically be possible to have virsh compute the list
	of descendants of a given snapshot, then delete those one at
	a time.  But it's complex, and not worth writing for a first
	cut at implementing the new flags.

	* tools/virsh.c (cmdSnapshotDelete): Add --children-only,
	--metadata.
	* tools/virsh.pod (snapshot-delete): Document them.

2011-09-05  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: introduce new deletion flag
	Reverting to a state prior to an external snapshot risks
	corrupting any other branches in the snapshot hierarchy that
	were using the snapshot as a read-only backing file.  So
	disk snapshot code will default to preventing reverting to
	a snapshot that has any children, meaning that deleting just
	the children of a snapshot becomes a useful operation in
	preparing that snapshot for being a future reversion target.
	The code for the new flag is simple - it's one less deletion,
	plus a tweak to keep the current snapshot correct.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in
	(VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_DELETE_CHILDREN_ONLY): New flag.
	* src/libvirt.c (virDomainSnapshotDelete): Document it, and
	enforce mutual exclusion.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotDelete): Implement
	it.

2011-09-05  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: reject transient disks where code is not ready
	The previous patch introduced new config, but if a hypervisor does
	not support that new config, someone can write XML that does not
	behave as documented.  This prevents some of those cases by
	explicitly rejecting transient disks for several hypervisors.

	Disk snapshots will require a new flag to actually affect a snapshot
	creation, so there's not much to reject there.

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c (qemuBuildDriveStr): Reject transient
	disks for now.

	At least Xen-3.4.3 translates the /vm/localtime SXPR value to

	handles HVM domains, but not PV domains: This results in libvirtd always

	    <clock offset="utc"/>
	while Xend used (localtime 1).

	For PV domains use /domain/image/linux/localtime.

	snapshot: store qemu domain details in xml
	When reverting to a snapshot, the inactive domain configuration
	has to be rolled back to what it was at the time of the snapshot.
	Additionally, if the VM is active and the snapshot was active,
	this now adds a failure if the two configurations are ABI
	incompatible, rather than risking qemu confusion.

	A future patch will add a VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_FORCE flag, which
	will be required for two risky code paths - reverting to an
	older snapshot that lacked full domain information, and reverting
	from running to a live snapshot that requires starting a new qemu
	process.  Any reverting that stops a running vm is also a form
	of data loss (discarding the current running state to go back in
	time), but as that is what reversion usually implies, it is
	probably not worth requiring a force flag.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Copy out

	snapshot: update rng to support full domain in xml
	This patch will probably cause merge conflicts to those trying
	to do backports.  The end goal is simple - domaincommon.rng
	should be the state of domain.rng pre-patch, with a few lines
	tweaked in the header, while domain.rng post-patch is now just
	a shell that includes domaincommon.rng and sets the <start>.

	snapshot: allow full domain xml in snapshot
	Just like VM saved state images (virsh save), snapshots MUST
	track the inactive domain xml to detect any ABI incompatibilities.

	The indentation is not perfect, but functionality comes before form.

	Later patches will actually supply a full domain; for now, this
	wires up the storage to support one, but doesn't ever generate one
	in dumpxml output.

	Happily, libvirt.c was already rejecting use of VIR_DOMAIN_XML_SECURE
	from read-only connections, even though before this patch, there was
	no information to be secured by the use of that flag.

	And while we're at it, mark the libvirt snapshot metadata files

	snapshot: prevent migration from stranding snapshot data
	Migration is another case of stranding metadata.  And since
	snapshot metadata is arbitrarily large, there's no way to
	shoehorn it into the migration cookie of migration v3.

	This patch consolidates two existing locations for migration
	validation into one helper function, then enhances that function
	to also do the new checks.  If we could always trust the source
	to validate migration, then the destination would not have to
	do anything; but since older servers that did not do checking
	can migrate to newer destinations, we have to repeat some of
	the same checks on the destination; meanwhile, we want to
	detect failures as soon as possible.  With migration v2, this
	means that validation will reject things at Prepare on the
	destination if the XML exposes the problem, otherwise at Perform
	on the source; with migration v3, this means that validation
	will reject things at Begin on the source, or if the source
	is old and the XML exposes the problem, then at Prepare on the
	destination.

	This patch is necessarily over-strict.  Once a later patch
	properly handles auto-cleanup of snapshot metadata on the
	death of a transient domain, then the only time we actually
	need snapshots to prevent migration is when using the
	--undefinesource flag on a persistent source domain.

	It is possible to recreate snapshot metadata on the destination
	with VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_REDEFINE and
	VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_CURRENT.  But for now, that is limited,
	since if we delete the snapshot metadata prior to migration,
	then we won't know the name of the current snapshot to pass
	along; and if we delete the snapshot metadata after migration
	and use the v3 migration cookie to pass along the name of the
	current snapshot, then we need a way to bypass the fact that
	this patch refuses migration with snapshot metadata present.

	So eventually, we may have to introduce migration protocol v4
	that allows feature negotiation and an arbitrary number of
	handshake exchanges, so as to pass as many rpc calls as needed
	to transfer all the snapshot xml hierarchy.

	But all of that is thoughts for the future; for now, the best
	course of action is to quit early, rather than get into a
	funky state of stale metadata; then relax restrictions later.

	snapshot: support new undefine flags in qemu
	A nice benefit of deleting all snapshots at undefine time is that
	you don't have to do any reparenting or subtree identification - since
	everything goes, this is an O(n) process, whereas using multiple
	virDomainSnapshotDelete calls would be O(n^2) or worse.  But it is
	only doable for snapshot metadata, where we are in control of the
	data being deleted; for the actual snapshots, there's too much
	likelihood of something going wrong, and requiring even more API
	calls to figure out what failed in the meantime, so callers are
	better off deleting the snapshot data themselves one snapshot at
	a time where they can deal with failures as they happen.

	snapshot: teach virsh about new undefine flags
	Similar to 'undefine --managed-save' (commit 83e849c1), we must
	assume that the old API is unsafe; however, we cannot emulate
	metadata-only deletion on older servers.  Additionally, we have
	the wrinkle that while virDomainUndefineFlags and managed save
	cleanup were introduced in 0.9.4, it wasn't until 0.9.5 that
	snapshots block undefine of a domain.  Do the best we can given
	the server we are talking to.

	snapshot: prevent stranding snapshot data on domain destruction
	Just as leaving managed save metadata behind can cause problems
	when creating a new domain that happens to collide with the name
	of the just-deleted domain, the same is true of leaving any
	snapshot metadata behind.  For safety sake, extend the semantic
	change of commit b26a9fa9 to also cover snapshot metadata as a
	reason to reject undefining an inactive domain.  A future patch
	will make sure that shutdown of a transient domain automatically
	deletes snapshot metadata (whether by destroy, shutdown, or
	guest-initiated action).  Management apps of transient domains
	should take care to capture xml of snapshots, if it is necessary
	to recreate the snapshot metadata on a later transient domain
	with the same name and uuid.

	This also documents a new flag that hypervisors can choose to
	support as a shortcut for taking care of the metadata as part of
	the undefine process; however, nontrivial driver support for these
	flags will be deferred to future patches.

	Note that ESX and VBox can never be transient; therefore, they
	do not have to worry about automatic cleanup after shutdown
	(the persistent domain still remains); likewise they never
	store snapshot metadata, so the undefine flag is trivial.
	The nontrivial work remaining is thus in the qemu driver.

	Redefining a qemu snapshot requires a bit of a tweak to the common
	snapshot parsing code, but the end result is quite nice.

	Be careful that redefinitions do not introduce circular parent
	chains.  Also, we don't want to allow conversion between online

	snapshot: add qemu snapshot creation without metadata
	Supporting NO_METADATA on snapshot creation is interesting - we must
	still return a valid opaque snapshot object, but the user can't get
	anything out of it (unless we add a virDomainSnapshotGetName()),
	since it is no longer registered with the domain.

	Also, virsh now tries to query for secure xml, in anticipation of

	Wire up the new snapshot creation flags in virsh.  For convenience,
	teach 'snapshot-current' how to make an existing snapshot become
	current (can be used after upgrading to newer libvirt to recover
	from the fact that the older libvirt lost track of the current
	snapshot after a restart).  The snapshot-create-as command is
	intentionally not taught --redefine or --current, as this would
	imply adding a lot of other options for everything else that can
	appear in the <domainsnapshot> xml, but which is normally read-only.
	Besides, redefining will usually be done on files created by

	snapshot: allow recreation of metadata
	The first two flags are essential for being able to replicate
	snapshot hierarchies across multiple hosts, which will come in
	handy for supervised migrations.  It also allows a management app
	to take a snapshot of a transient domain, save the metadata, stop
	the domain, recreate a new transient domain by the same name,
	redefine the snapshot, then revert to it.

	This is not quite as convenient as leaving the metadata behind
	after a domain is no longer around, but doing that has a few
	problems: 1. the libvirt API can only delete snapshot metadata
	if there is a valid domain handle to use to get to that snapshot
	object - if stale data is left behind without a domain, there is
	no way to request that the data be cleaned up. 2. creating a new
	domain with the same name but different uuid than the older
	domain where a snapshot existed cannot use the older snapshot
	data; this risks confusing libvirt, and forbidding the stale
	data is similar to the recent patch to forbid stale managed save.

	The first two flags might be useful on hypervisors with no metadata,
	but only for modifying the notion of the current snapshot;
	however, I don't know how to do that for ESX or VBox.

	The third flag is a convenience option, to combine a creation with
	a delete metadata into one step.  It is trivial for hypervisors
	with no metadata.

	The qemu changes will be involved enough to warrant a separate patch.

	snapshot: allow deletion of just snapshot metadata
	A future patch will make it impossible to remove a domain if it
	would leave behind any libvirt-tracked metadata about snapshots,
	since stale metadata interferes with a new domain by the same name.
	But requiring snaphot contents to be deleted before removing a
	domain is harsh; with qemu, qemu-img can still make use of the
	contents after the libvirt domain is gone.  Therefore, we need
	an option to get rid of libvirt tracking information, but not
	the actual contents.  For hypervisors that do not track any
	metadata in libvirt, the implementation is trivial; all remaining

	snapshot: track current domain across deletion of children
	Deleting a snapshot and all its descendants had problems with
	tracking the current snapshot.  The deletion does not necessarily
	proceed in depth-first order, so a parent could be deleted
	before a child, wreaking havoc on passing the notion of the
	current snapshot to the parent.  Furthermore, even if traversal

	snapshot: avoid crash when deleting qemu snapshots
	This one's nasty.  Ever since we fixed virHashForEach to prevent
	nested hash iterations for safety reasons (commit fba550f6),
	virDomainSnapshotDelete with VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_DELETE_CHILDREN
	has been broken for qemu: it deletes children, while leaving
	grandchildren intact but pointing to a no-longer-present parent.
	But even before then, the code would often appear to succeed to
	clean up grandchildren, but risked memory corruption if you have
	a large and deep hierarchy of snapshots.

	For acting on just children, a single virHashForEach is sufficient.
	But for acting on an entire subtree, it requires iteration; and
	since we declared recursion as invalid, we have to switch to a
	while loop.  Doing this correctly requires quite a bit of overhaul,
	so I added a new helper function to isolate the algorithm from the
	actions, so that callers do not have to reinvent the iteration.

	Note that this _still_ does not handle CHILDREN correctly if one
	of the children is the current snapshot; that will be next.

	snapshot: properly revert qemu to offline snapshots
	Commit 5e47785 broke reverts to offline system checkpoint snapshots
	with older qemu, since there is no longer any code path to use
	qemu -loadvm on next boot.  Meanwhile, reverts to offline system
	checkpoints have been broken for newer qemu, both before and
	after that commit, since -loadvm no longer works to revert to
	disk state without accompanying vm state.  Fix both of these by
	using qemu-img to revert disk state.

	Meanwhile, consolidate the (now 3) clients of a qemu-img iteration
	over all disks of a VM into one function, so that any future
	algorithmic fixes to the FIXMEs in that function after partial
	loop iterations are dealt with at once.  That does mean that this

	If you take a checkpoint snapshot of a running domain, then pause

	you take a checkpoint of a paused domain, then run, then restore,
	there was a brief but non-deterministic window of time where the
	domain was running rather than paused.  Fix both of these

	snapshot: better events when starting paused
	There are two classes of management apps that track events - one
	that only cares about on/off (and only needs to track EVENT_STARTED
	and EVENT_STOPPED), and one that cares about paused/running (also
	tracks EVENT_SUSPENDED/EVENT_RESUMED).  To keep both classes happy,
	any transition that can go from inactive to paused must emit two
	back-to-back events - one for started and one for suspended (since
	later resuming of the domain will only send RESUMED, but the first
	class isn't tracking that).

	storage: Add virsh support for fs pool formating

2011-09-02  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	storage: Add fs pool formatting
	This patch adds the ability to make the filesystem for a filesystem
	pool during a pool build.

	The patch adds two new flags, no overwrite and overwrite, to control
	when mkfs gets executed.  By default, the patch preserves the
	current behavior, i.e., if no flags are specified, pool build on a
	filesystem pool only makes the directory on which the filesystem
	will be mounted.

	If the no overwrite flag is specified, the target device is checked
	to determine if a filesystem of the type specified in the pool is
	present.  If a filesystem of that type is already present, mkfs is
	not executed and the build call returns an error.  Otherwise, mkfs
	is executed and any data present on the device is overwritten.

	If the overwrite flag is specified, mkfs is always executed, and any
	existing data on the target device is overwritten unconditionally.

	qemu: detect incomplete save files
	Several users have reported problems with 'virsh start' failing because
	it was encountering a managed save situation where the managed save file
	was incomplete.  Be more robust to this by using two different magic
	numbers, so that newer libvirt can gracefully handle an incomplete file
	differently than a complete one, while older libvirt will at least fail
	up front rather than trying to load only to have qemu fail at the end.

	Managed save is a convenience - it exists to preserve as much state
	as possible; if the state was not preserved, it is reasonable to just
	log that fact, then proceed with a fresh boot.  On the other hand,
	user saves are under user control, so we must fail, but by making
	the failure message distinct, the user can better decide how to handle
	the situation of an incomplete save file.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (QEMUD_SAVE_PARTIAL): New define.
	(qemuDomainSaveInternal): Use it to mark incomplete images.
	(qemuDomainSaveImageOpen, qemuDomainObjRestore): Add parameter
	that controls what to do with partial images.
	(qemuDomainRestoreFlags, qemuDomainSaveImageGetXMLDesc)
	(qemuDomainSaveImageDefineXML, qemuDomainObjStart): Update callers.
	Based on an initial idea by Osier Yang.

	qemu: refactor file opening
	In a SELinux or root-squashing NFS environment, libvirt has to go
	through some hoops to create a new file that qemu can then open()
	by name.  Snapshots are a case where we want to guarantee an empty
	file that qemu can open; also, reopening a save file to convert it
	from being marked partial to complete requires a reopen to avoid
	O_DIRECT headaches.  Refactor some existing code to make it easier
	to reuse in later patches.

	* src/qemu/qemu_migration.h (qemuMigrationToFile): Drop parameter.
	* src/qemu/qemu_migration.c (qemuMigrationToFile): Let cgroup do
	the stat, rather than asking caller to do it and pass info down.

	lxc: do not require 'ifconfig' or 'ipconfig' in container
	Currently, the lxc implementation invokes 'ip' and 'ifconfig' commands
	inside a container using 'virRun'.  That has the side effect of requiring
	those commands to be present and to function in a manner consistent with
	the usage.  Some small roots (such as ttylinux) may not have 'ip' or
	'ifconfig'.

	This patch replaces the use of these commands with usage of
	netdevice.  The result is that lxc containers do not have to implement
	those commands, and lxc in libvirt is only dependent on the netdevice
	interface.

	I've tested this patch locally against the ubuntu libvirt version enough
	to verify its generally sane.  I attempted to build upstream today, but
	failed with:
	  /usr/bin/ld:
	    ../src/.libs/libvirt_driver_qemu.a(libvirt_driver_qemu_la-qemu_domain.o):

	Create ptmx as a device
	Hi,

	I'm seeing an issue with udev and libvirt-lxc.  Libvirt-lxc creates
	/dev/ptmx as a symlink to /dev/pts/ptmx.  When udev starts up, it
	checks the device type, sees ptmx is 'not right', and replaces it
	with a 'proper' ptmx.

	In lxc, /dev/ptmx is bind-mounted from /dev/pts/ptmx instead of being
	symlinked, so udev sees the right device type and leaves it alone.

	A patch like the following seems to work for me.  Would there be
	any objections to this?

	Date: Wed, 31 Aug 2011 18:15:54 +0000
	Subject: [PATCH 1/1] make ptmx a bind mount rather than symlink

	udev on some systems checks the device type of /dev/ptmx, and replaces it if
	not as expected.  The symlink created by libvirt-lxc therefore gets replaced.
	By creating it as a bind mount, the device type is correct and udev leaves it
	alone.

	BlockPull: Set initial bandwidth limit if specified
	The libvirt BlockPull API supports the use of an initial bandwidth limit but the
	qemu block_stream API does not.  To get the desired behavior we use the two APIs
	strung together: first BlockPull, then BlockJobSetSpeed.  We can do this at the
	driver level to avoid duplicated code in each monitor path.

2011-09-02  Adam Litke  <agl@us.ibm.com>

	BlockJob: Bandwidth parameter is in MB when using text monitor
	Due to an unfortunate precedent in qemu, the units for the bandwidth parameter
	to block_job_set_speed are different between the text monitor and the qmp
	monitor.  While the qmp monitor uses bytes/s, the text monitor expects MB/s.

	Correct the units for the text interface.

	Fix tracking of RPC messages wrt streams
	Commit 2c85644b0b51fbe5b6244e6773531af29933a727 attempted to
	fix a problem with tracking RPC messages from streams by doing

	-            if (msg->header.type == VIR_NET_REPLY) {
	+            if (msg->header.type == VIR_NET_REPLY ||
	+                (msg->header.type == VIR_NET_STREAM &&
	+                 msg->header.status != VIR_NET_CONTINUE)) {
	                 client->nrequests--;

	In other words any stream packet, with status NET_OK or NET_ERROR
	would cause nrequests to be decremented. This is great if the
	packet from from a synchronous virStreamFinish or virStreamAbort
	API call, but wildly wrong if from a server initiated abort.
	The latter resulted in 'nrequests' being decremented below zero.
	This then causes all I/O for that client to be stopped.

	Instead of trying to infer whether we need to decrement the
	nrequests field, from the message type/status, introduce an
	explicit 'bool tracked' field to mark whether the virNetMessagePtr
	object is subject to tracking.

	Also add a virNetMessageClear function to allow a message
	contents to be cleared out, without adversely impacting the
	'tracked' field as a naive memset() would do

	* src/rpc/virnetmessage.c, src/rpc/virnetmessage.h: Add
	  a 'bool tracked' field and virNetMessageClear() API
	* daemon/remote.c, daemon/stream.c, src/rpc/virnetclientprogram.c,
	  src/rpc/virnetclientstream.c, src/rpc/virnetserverclient.c,

	Back in 2008 when this line of util.h was written, gnulib's verify
	module didn't allow the use of multiple verify() in one file
	in combination with our choice of gcc -W options.  But that has
	since been fixed in gnulib, and newer gnulib even maps verify()
	to the C1x feature of _Static_assert, which gives even nicer
	diagnostics with a new enough compiler, so we might as well go
	with the simpler verify().

	hyperv: Add basic documentation

2011-08-26  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	hyperv: Add basic driver for Microsoft Hyper-V
	Domain listing, basic information retrieval and domain life cycle
	management is implemented. But currently the domain XML output
	lacks the complete devices section.

	The driver uses OpenWSMAN to directly communicate with a Hyper-V
	server over its WS-Management interface exposed via Microsoft WinRM.

	The driver is based on the work of Michael Sievers. This started in
	the same master program project group at the University of Paderborn
	as the ESX driver.

	See Michael's blog for details: http://hyperv4libvirt.wordpress.com/

	Fix persistent migration config save
	When a user migrates a domain by command as

	  ...

	rpc: Don't close connection if program is unknown
	In case we add a new program in the future (we did that in the past and
	we are going to do it again soon) current daemon will behave badly with
	new client that wants to use the new program. Before the RPC rewrite we
	used to just send an error reply to any request with unknown program.
	With the RPC rewrite in 0.9.3 the daemon just closes the connection
	through which such request was sent. This patch fixes this regression.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Treat non-"" reply data as an
	  error message for 'sendkey' command

2011-08-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix keymap used to talk with QEMU
	The QEMU 'sendkey' command expects keys to be encoded in the same
	way as the RFB extended keycode set. Specifically it wants extended
	keys to have the high bit of the first byte set, while the Linux
	XT KBD driver codeset uses the low bit of the second byte. To deal
	with this we introduce a new keymap 'RFB' and use that in the QEMU
	driver

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Add VIR_KEYCODE_SET_RFB
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use RFB keycode set instead of XT KBD

	virsh: Clarify documentation of -d option
	The default is 4, not 0.

	qemu: Correctly label migration TCP socket

	security: Introduce SetSocketLabel
	This API labels all sockets created until ClearSocketLabel is called in
	a way that a vm can access them (i.e., they are labeled with svirt_t
	based label in SELinux).

	security: Rename SetSocketLabel APIs to SetDaemonSocketLabel
	The APIs are designed to label a socket in a way that the libvirt daemon
	itself is able to access it (i.e., in SELinux the label is virtd_t based
	as opposed to svirt_* we use for labeling resources that need to be
	accessed by a vm). The new name reflects this.

	Ignore unused streams in virStreamAbort
	When virStreamAbort is called on a stream that has not been used yet,
	quite confusing error is returned: "this function is not supported by
	the connection driver". Let's just ignore such streams as there's
	nothing to abort anyway.

	Do not try to cancel non-existent migration on source
	If migration failed on source daemon, the migration is automatically
	canceled by the daemon itself. Thus we don't need to call
	virDomainMigrateConfirm3(cancelled=1). Calling it doesn't cause any harm
	but the resulting error message printed in logs may confuse people.

2011-08-26  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	snapshot: only pass snapshot to qemu command line when reverting
	Changing the current vm, and writing that change to the file
	system, all before a new qemu starts, is risky; it's hard to
	roll back if starting the new qemu fails for some reason.
	Instead of abusing vm->current_snapshot and making the command
	line generator decide whether the current snapshot warrants
	using -loadvm, it is better to just directly pass a snapshot all
	the way through the call chain if it is to be loaded.

	This frees up the last use of snapshot->def->active for qemu's
	use, so the next patch can repurpose that field for tracking
	which snapshot is current.

	snapshot: don't leak resources on qemu snapshot failure
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=727709
	mentions that if qemu fails to create the snapshot (such as what
	happens on Fedora 15 qemu, which has qmp but where savevm is only
	in hmp, and where libvirt is old enough to not try the hmp fallback),
	then 'virsh snapshot-list dom' will show a garbage snapshot entry,
	and the libvirt internal directory for storing snapshot metadata
	will have a bogus file.

	This fixes the fallout bug of polluting the snapshot-list with
	garbage on failure (the root cause of the F15 bug of not having
	fallback to hmp has already been fixed in newer libvirt releases).

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemuDomainSnapshotCreateXML): Allocate
	memory before making snapshot, and cleanup on failure.  Don't

	Fix command test wrt gnutls initialize & fix debugging
	The VIR_TEST_DEBUG and VIR_TEST_VERBOSE env vars did not work
	because we replaced 'environ' with 'newenv'. Simply calling
	virTestGetDebug/Verbose() before replacing the 'environ' ensures
	we have processed the env variables.

	The gnutls initialization code opens /dev/urandom and keeps that
	FD around for later use. We have code which kills off FDs 3-5
	to avoid interfereing with our test case. Move the virInitialize

	util: only fchown newly created files in virFileOpenAs
	virFileOpenAs takes desired uid:gid as arguments, and not only uses
	them for a fork/setuid/setgid when retrying failed open operations,
	but additionally always forces the opened file to be owned by the
	given uid:gid.

	One example of the problems this causes is that, when restoring a
	domain from a file that is owned by the qemu user, opening the file
	chowns it to root. if dynamic_ownership=1 this is coincidentally
	expected, but if dynamic_ownership=0, no existing file should ever
	have its ownership changed.

	This patch adds an extra check before calling fchown() - it only does
	it if O_CREAT was passed to virFileOpenAs() in the openflags.

	Revert "xen: Allow to undefine a running domain (xm_internal)"
	ACK was given too soon.  According to the code, the xm driver is
	only used for inactive domains, and has no notion of an active
	domain, thus, it cannot support undefine of a running domain.
	The real fix for xen needs to be in the unified driver and/or
	the xend level.

	This reverts commit 49186deda62161599877b0de6f7f4345c50d842a.

	daemon: initialize GnuTLS
	When spice_tls is set but listen_tls is not, we don't initialize
	GnuTLS library. So any later gnutls call (e.g. during migration,
	where we initialize a certificate) will access uninitialized GnuTLS
	internal structs and throws an error.

	Although, we might now initialize GnuTLS twice, it is safe according
	to the documentation:

	    This function can be called many times,
	    but will only do something the first time.

	with respect to written above.

	Ensure async packets never get marked for sync replies
	If a client had initiated a stream abort, it will have a call

	Don't attempt to read from a stream if it is closed
	The I/O event callback processes incoming packets first, and then
	does outgoing packets. If the incoming packet caused the stream to
	close, then the attempt to process outgoing data resulted in an
	error. This caused libvirt to then send an error back to the client,
	but the stream had already been stopped. This confused the client

	Fix race condition in abort of stream
	If a stream gets a server initiated abort, the client may still
	send an abort request before it receives the server side abort.
	This causes the server to send back another abort for the
	stream. Since the protocol defines that abort is the last thing
	to be sent, the client gets confused by this second abort from
	the server. If the stream is already shutdown, just drop any
	client requested abort, rather than sending back another message.
	This fixes the regression from previous versions.

	Tested as follows

	In one virsh session

	  virsh # start foo
	  virsh # console foo

	In other virsh session

	  virsh # destroy foo

	The first virsh session should be able to continue issuing
	commands without error. Prior to this patch it saw

	  virsh # list
	  error: Failed to list active domains
	  error: An error occurred, but the cause is unknown

	  virsh # list
	  error: Failed to list active domains
	  error: no call waiting for reply with prog 536903814 vers 1 serial 9

2011-08-17  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ensure client streams are closed when marking a client for close
	Every active stream results in a reference being held on the
	virNetServerClientPtr object. This meant that if a client quit
	with any streams active, although all I/O was stopped the
	virNetServerClientPtr object would leak. This causes libvirtd
	to leak any file handles associated with open streams when a
	client quit

	To fix this, when we call virNetServerClientClose there is a
	callback invoked which lets the daemon release the streams
	and thus the extra references

	* daemon/remote.c: Add a hook to close all streams
	* daemon/stream.c, daemon/stream.h: Add API for releasing
	  all streams
	* src/rpc/virnetserverclient.c, src/rpc/virnetserverclient.h:

	qemu: support event_idx parameter for virtio disk and net devices
	In some versions of qemu, both virtio-blk-pci and virtio-net-pci
	devices can have an event_idx setting that determines some details of
	event processing. When it is enabled, it "reduces the number of
	interrupts and exits for the guest". qemu will automatically enable
	this feature when it is available, but there may be cases where this
	new feature could actually make performance worse (NB: no such case
	has been found so far).

	As a safety switch in case such a situation is encountered in the
	field, this patch adds a new attribute "event_idx" to the <driver>
	element of both disk and interface devices. event_idx can be set to
	"on" (to force event_idx on in case qemu has it disabled by default)
	or "off" (for force event_idx off). In the case that event_idx support
	isn't present in qemu, the attribute is ignored (this on the advice of
	the qemu developer).

	Add some APIs which use locking for crashsafe pidfile handling
	In daemons using pidfiles to protect against concurrent

	qemu: Fix -chardev udp if parameters are omitted
	The following XML:

	    <serial type='udp'>
	      <source mode='connect' service='9999'/>
	    </serial>

	is accepted by domain_conf.c but maps to the qemu command line:

	-chardev udp,host=127.0.0.1,port=2222,localaddr=(null),localport=(null)

	qemu can cope with everything omitting except the connection port, which
	seems to also be the intent of domain_conf validation, so let's not
	generate bogus command lines for that case.
	The defaults are empty strings for addresses and 0 for the localport

	Additionally, tweak the qemu cli parsing to handle omitted host
	parameters
	for -serial udp

	managedsave: prohibit use on transient domains
	Transient domains reject attempts to set autostart, and using
	virDomainCreate to restart a domain only works on persistent
	domains.  Therefore, managed save makes no sense on transient
	domains, and should be rejected up front rather than creating
	an otherwise unrecoverable managed save file.

	Besides, transient domains imply that a lot more management is
	being done by the upper layer; this includes the assumption
	that the upper layer is okay managing the saved state file
	created by virDomainSave, and does not need to use managed save.

	Allow use of file images for LXC container filesystems
	A previous commit gave the LXC driver the ability to mount

	network: eliminate lag in updating dnsmasq hosts files
	This addresses https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=713728

	When "defining" a new network (or one that exists but isn't currently
	active) the new definition is stored in network->def, but for a
	network that already exists and is active, the new definition is
	stored in network->newDef, and then moved over to network->def as soon
	as the network is destroyed.

	However, the code that writes the dhcp and dns hosts files used by
	dnsmasq was always using network->def for its information, even when
	the new data was actually in network->newDef, so the hosts files
	always lagged one edit behind the definition.

	This patch changes the code to keep the pointer to the new definition
	after it's been assigned into the network, and use it directly
	(regardless of whether it's stored in network->newDef or network->def)
	to construct the hosts files.

	qemu: fix crash when mixing sync and async monitor jobs
	Currently, we attempt to run sync job and async job at the same time. It
	means that the monitor commands for two jobs can be run in any order.

	In the function qemuDomainObjEnterMonitorInternal():
	    if (priv->job.active == QEMU_JOB_NONE && priv->job.asyncJob) {
	        if (qemuDomainObjBeginNestedJob(driver, obj) < 0)
	We check whether the caller is an async job by priv->job.active and
	priv->job.asynJob. But when an async job is running, and a sync job is
	also running at the time of the check, then priv->job.active is not
	QEMU_JOB_NONE. So we cannot check whether the caller is an async job
	in the function qemuDomainObjEnterMonitorInternal(), and must instead
	put the burden on the caller to tell us when an async command wants
	to do a nested job.

	Once the burden is on the caller, then only async monitor enters need
	to worry about whether the VM is still running; for sync monitor enter,
	the internal return is always 0, so lots of ignore_value can be dropped.

	executed for a inactive guest in qemuDomainSetMemoryParameters:
	ret = virDomainSaveConfig(driver->configDir, persistentDef);
	and if everything is okay, 'ret' is assigned to 0, the previous 'ret'
	will be overwritten, this patch will fix this issue.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: avoid return value is overwritten when set
	  min_guarante value to a inactive guest.

	* how to reproduce?
	  % virsh memtune ${guestname} --min_guarante 1024
	  % echo $?

	  Note: guest must be inactive, in fact, 'min_guarante' hasn't been implemented
	  in memory tunable, and I can get the error when check actual libvirtd.log,
	  however, virsh hasn't raised any error information, and return value is 0.

	network: don't forward DNS requests from isolated networks
	This is in response to:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=723862

	which points out that a guest on an "isolated" network could
	potentially exploit the DNS forwarding provided by dnsmasq to create a
	communication channel to the outside.

	This patch eliminates that possibility by adding the "--no-resolv"
	argument to the dnsmasq commandline, which tells dnsmasq to not
	forward on any requests that it can't resolve itself (by looking at
	its own static hosts files and runtime list of dhcp clients), but to
	instead return a failure for those requests.

	This shouldn't cause any undesirable change from current
	behavior, even in the case where a guest is currently configured with
	multiple interfaces, one of them being connected to an isolated
	network, and another to a network that does have connectivity to the
	outside. If the isolated network's DNS server is queried for a name
	it doesn't know, it will return "Refused" rather than "Unknown", which
	indicates to the guest that it should query other servers, so it then
	queries the connected DNS server, and gets the desired response.

	freebsd: Fix build problem due to picking up the wrong libvirt.h
	Gettext annoyingly modifies CPPFLAGS in-place, putting
	-I/usr/local/include into the search patch if libintl headers
	must be used from that location.  But since we must support
	automake 1.9.6 which lacks AM_CPPFLAGS, and since CPPFLAGS is used
	prior to INCLUDES, this means that the build picks up the _old_
	installed libvirt.h in priority to the in-tree version, leading
	to all sorts of weird build failures on FreeBSD.

	Fix this by teaching configure to undo gettext's actions, but
	to keep any changes required by gettext at the end of INCLUDES
	after all in-tree locations are used first.  Also requires
	adding a wrapper Makefile.am and making gnulib-tool create
	just gnulib.mk files during the bootstrap process.

	libxl: fix build failure due to change in virDomainGraphicsDef
	This failure was introduced by commit dacee3d, which removed
	listenAddr from the unions in virDomainGraphicsDef in favor of putting
	it in the address attribute of virDomainGraphicsListenDef.

2011-07-29  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: support type=network in domain graphics <listen>
	The domain XML now understands the <listen> subelement of its
	<graphics> element (including when listen type='network'), and the
	network driver has an internal API that will turn a network name into
	an IP address, so the final logical step is to put the glue into the
	qemu driver so that when it is starting up a domain, if it finds
	<listen type='network' network='xyz'/> in the XML, it will call the
	network driver to get an IPv4 address associated with network xyz, and
	tell qemu to listen for vnc (or spice) on that address rather than the
	default address (localhost).

	The motivation for this is that a large installation may want the
	guests' VNC servers listening on physical interfaces rather than
	localhost, so that users can connect directly from the outside; this
	requires sending qemu the appropriate IP address to listen on. But
	this address will of course be different for each host, and if a guest
	might be migrated around from one host to another, it's important that
	the guest's config not have any information embedded in it that is
	specific to one particular host. <listen type='network.../> can solve
	this problem in the following manner:

	  1) on each host, define a libvirt network of the same name,
	     associated with the interface on that host that should be used
	     for listening (for example, a simple macvtap network: <forward
	     mode='bridge' dev='eth0'/>, or host bridge network: <forward
	     mode='bridge'/> <bridge name='br0'/>

	  2) in the <graphics> element of each guest's domain xml, tell vnc to
	     listen on the network name used in step 1:

	     <graphics type='vnc' port='5922'>
	       <listen type='network'network='example-net'/>
	     </graphics>

	(all the above also applies for graphics type='spice').

2011-07-29  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: add <listen> subelement to domain <graphics> element
	Once it's plugged in, the <listen> element will be an optional
	replacement for the "listen" attribute that graphics elements already
	have. If the <listen> element is type='address', it will have an
	attribute called 'address' which will contain an IP address or dns
	name that the guest's display server should listen on. If, however,
	type='network', the <listen> element should have an attribute called
	'network' that will be set to the name of a network configuration to
	get the IP address from.

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: updated to allow the <listen> element

	* docs/formatdomain.html.in: document the <listen> element and its
	  attributes.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.[hc]:

	  1) The domain parser, formatter, and data structure are modified to
	     support 0 or more <listen> subelements to each <graphics>
	     element. The old style "legacy" listen attribute is also still
	     accepted, and will be stored internally just as if it were a
	     separate <listen> element. On output (i.e. format), the address
	     attribute of the first <listen> element of type 'address' will be
	     duplicated in the legacy "listen" attribute of the <graphic>
	     element.

	  2) The "listenAddr" attribute has been removed from the unions in
	     virDomainGRaphicsDef for graphics types vnc, rdp, and spice.
	     This attribute is now in the <listen> subelement (aka
	     virDomainGraphicsListenDef)

	  3) Helper functions were written to provide simple access
	     (both Get and Set) to the listen elements and their attributes.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the listen helper functions

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c, src/qemu/qemu_hotplug.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_migration.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c,
	  src/vmx/vmx.c, src/xenxs/xen_sxpr.c, src/xenxs/xen_xm.c

	  Modify all these files to use the listen helper functions rather
	  than directly referencing the (now missing) listenAddr
	  attribute. There can be multiple <listen> elements to a single
	  <graphics>, but the drivers all currently only support one, so all
	  replacements of direct access with a helper function indicate index
	  "0".

	* tests/* - only 3 of these are new files added explicitly to test the
	  new <listen> element. All the others have been modified to reflect
	  the fact that any legacy "listen" attributes passed in to the domain
	  parse will be saved in a <listen> element (i.e. one of the
	  virDomainGraphicsListenDefs), and during the domain format function,
	  both the <listen> element as well as the legacy attributes will be
	  output.

	will not be protected against changes between Begin and Perform steps.

	bandwidth: Integrate bandwidth into portgroups
	Every DomainNetDef has a bandwidth, as does every portgroup.
	Whenever a DomainNetDef of type NETWORK is about to be used, a call is
	made to networkAllocateActualDevice(). This function chooses the "best"
	bandwidth object and places it in the DomainActualNetDef.
	From that point on, whenever some code needs to use the bandwidth data
	for the interface, it's retrieved with virDomainNetGetActualBandwidth(),
	which will always return the "best" info as determined in the
	previous step.

	Fix race in ref counting when handling RPC jobs
	When an incoming RPC message is ready for processing,

	  virNetServerClientDispatchRead()

	will invoke the 'dispatchFunc' callback. This is set to

	  virNetServerDispatchNewMessage

	This function puts the message + client in a queue for processing by the thread
	pool. The thread pool worker function is

	  virNetServerHandleJob

	The first thing this does is acquire an extra reference on the 'client'.

	Unfortunately, between the time the message+client are put on the thread pool
	queue, and the time the worker runs, the client object may have had its last
	reference removed.

	We clearly need to add the reference to the client object before putting the

	util: change virFile*Pid functions to return < 0 on failure
	Although most functions in libvirt return 0 on success and < 0 on
	failure, there are a few functions lingering around that return errno
	(a positive value) on failure, and sometimes code calling those
	functions incorrectly assumes the <0 standard. I noticed one of these
	the other day when auditing networkStartDhcpDaemon after Guido Gunther
	found a place where success was improperly returned on failure (that
	patch has been acked and is pending a push). The problem was that it
	expected the return value from virFileReadPid to be < 0 on failure,
	but it was actually positive (it was also neglected to set the return
	code in this case, similar to the bug found by Guido).

	This all led to the fact that *all* of the virFile*Pid functions in
	util.c are returning errno on failure. This patch remedies that
	problem by changing them all to return -errno on failure, and makes
	any necessary changes to callers of the functions. (In the meantime, I
	also properly set the return code on failure of virFileReadPid in
	networkStartDhcpDaemon).

	network: provide internal API to return IP of a network
	The new listenNetwork attribute needs to learn an IP address based on a
	named network. This patch provides a function networkGetNetworkAddress
	which provides that.

	Some networks have an IP address explicitly in their configuration
	(ie, those with a forward type of "none", "route", or "nat"). For
	those, we can just return the IP address from the config.

	The rest will have a physical device associated with them (either via
	<bridge name='...'/>, <forward ... dev='...'/>, or possibly via a pool
	of interfaces inside the network's <forward> element) and we will need
	to ask the kernel for a current IP address of that device (via the
	newly added ifaceGetIPAddress)

	If networkGetNetworkAddress encounters an error while trying to learn
	the address for a network, it will return -1. In the case that libvirt
	has been compiled without the network driver, the call is a macro
	which reduces to -2. This allows differentiating between a failure of
	the network driver, and its complete absence.

2011-07-25  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	util: add an ifaceGetIPAddress to the interface utilities
	This function uses ioctl(SIOCGIFADDR), which limits it to returning
	the first IPv4 address of an interface, but that's what we want right
	now (the place we're going to use the address only accepts one).

	that won't be rejected due to abi breaks.  To make this more

	save: add virFileDirectFd wrapper type
	O_DIRECT has stringent requirements.  Rather than make lots of changes
	at each site that wants to use O_DIRECT, it is easier to offload
	the work through a helper process that mirrors the I/O between a
	pipe and the actual direct fd, so that the other end of the pipe
	no longer has to worry about constraints.

	Plus, if the kernel ever gains better posix_fadvise support, then we
	only have to touch a single file to let all callers benefit from a
	more efficient way to avoid file system caching.

2011-07-22  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	save: let iohelper work on O_DIRECT fds
	Required for a coming patch where iohelper will operate on O_DIRECT
	fds.  There, the user-space memory must be aligned to file system
	boundaries (at least 512, but using page-aligned works better, and
	some file systems prefer 64k).  Made tougher by the fact that
	VIR_ALLOC won't work on void *, but posix_memalign won't work on
	char * and isn't available everywhere.

	This patch makes some simplifying assumptions - namely, output
	to an O_DIRECT fd will only be attempted on an empty seekable
	file (hence, no need to worry about preserving existing data
	on a partial block, and ftruncate will work to undo the effects
	of having to round up the size of the last block written), and
	input from an O_DIRECT fd will only be attempted on a complete
	seekable file with the only possible short read at EOF.

	* configure.ac (AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE): Check for posix_memalign.
	* src/util/iohelper.c (runIO): Use aligned memory, and handle
	quirks of O_DIRECT on last write.

2011-07-22  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	save: let iohelper handle inherited fd
	Rather than making the iohelper subject to a race in reopening
	the file, it is nicer to pass an already-open fd by inheritance.

	The old synopsis form must continue to work - if someone updates
	their libvirt package and installs a new libvirt_iohelper but
	without restarting the old libvirtd daemon, then the daemon can
	still make calls using the old syntax but the new iohelper.

	error: add new error type for reflecting partial API support
	VIR_ERR_INVALID_ARG implies that an argument cannot possibly
	be correct, given the current state of the API.
	VIR_ERR_CONFIG_UNSUPPORTED implies that a configuration is
	wrong, but arguments aren't configuration.
	VIR_ERR_NO_SUPPORT implies that a function is completely
	unimplemented.

	But in the case of a function that is partially implemented,
	yet the full power of the API is not available for that
	driver, none of the above messages make sense.  Hence a new
	error message, implying that the argument is known to comply
	with the current state of the API, and that while the driver
	supports aspects of the function, it does not support that
	particular use of the argument.

	A good use case for this is a driver that supports
	virDomainSaveFlags, but not the dxml argument of that API.

	It might be feasible to also use this new error for all functions
	that check flags, and which accept fewer flags than what is possible
	in the public API.  But doing so would get complicated, since
	neither libvirt.c nor the remote driver may do flag filtering,
	and every other driver would have to do a two-part check, first
	using virCheckFlags on all public flags (which gives
	VIR_ERR_INVALID_ARG for an impossible flag), followed by a
	particular mask check for VIR_ERR_ARGUMENT_UNSUPPORTED (for a
	possible public flag but unsupported by this driver).

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h (VIR_ERR_ARGUMENT_UNSUPPORTED): New
	error.
	* src/util/virterror.c (virErrorMsg): Give it a message.
	Suggested by Daniel P. Berrange.

	network: internal API functions to manage assignment of physdev to guest
	The network driver needs to assign physical devices for use by modes
	that use macvtap, keeping track of which physical devices are in use
	(and how many instances, when the devices can be shared). Three calls
	are added:

	networkAllocateActualDevice - finds a physical device for use by the
	domain, and sets up the virDomainActualNetDef accordingly.

	networkNotifyActualDevice - assumes that the domain was already
	running, but libvirtd was restarted, and needs to be notified by each
	already-running domain about what interfaces they are using.

	networkReleaseActualDevice - decrements the usage count of the
	allocated physical device, and frees the virDomainActualNetDef to
	avoid later accidentally using the device.

	bridge_driver.[hc] - the new APIs. When WITH_NETWORK is false, these
	functions are all #defined to be "0" in the .h file (effectively
	becoming a NOP) to prevent link errors.

	qemu_(command|driver|hotplug|process).c - add calls to the above APIs
	    in the appropriate places.

	tests/Makefile.am - we need to include libvirt_driver_network.la
	    whenever libvirt_driver_qemu.la is linked, to avoid unreferenced
	    symbols (in functions that are never called by the test
	    programs...)

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: use virDomainNetGetActual*() in qemuDomainXMLToNative
	This is the one function outside of domain_conf.c that plays around
	with (even modifying) the internals of the virDomainNetDef, and thus
	can't be fixed up simply by replacing direct accesses to the fields of
	the struct with the GetActual*() access functions.

	In this case, we need to check if the defined type is "network", and
	if it is *then* check the actual type; if the actual type is "bridge",
	then we can at least put the bridgename in a place where it can be
	used; otherwise (if type isn't "bridge"), we behave exactly as we used
	to - just null out *everything*.

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: use virDomainNetGetActual*() functions where appropriate
	The qemu driver accesses fields in the virDomainNetDef directly, but
	with the advent of the virDomainActualNetDef, some pieces of
	information may be found in a different place (the ActualNetDef) if
	the network connection is of type='network' and that network is of
	forward type='bridge|private|vepa|passthrough'. The previous patch
	added functions to mask this difference from callers - they hide the
	decision making process and just pick the value from the proper place.

	This patch uses those functions in the qemu driver as a first step in
	making qemu work with the new network types. At this point, the
	virDomainActualNetDef is guaranteed always NULL, so the GetActualX()
	function will return exactly what the def->X that's being replaced
	would have returned (ie bisecting is not compromised).

	There is one place (in qemu_driver.c) where the internal details of
	the NetDef are directly manipulated by the code, so the GetActual
	functions cannot be used there without extra additional code; that
	file will be treated in a separate patch.

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	network: separate Start/Shutdown functions for new network types
	Previously all networks were composed of bridge devices created and
	managed by libvirt, and the same operations needed to be done for all
	of them when they were started and stopped (create and start the
	bridge device, configure its MAC address and IP address, add iptables
	rules). The new network types are (for now at least) managed outside
	of libvirt, and the network object is used only to contain information
	about the network, which is then used as each individual guest
	connects itself.

	This means that when starting/stopping one of these new networks, we
	really want to do nothing, aside from marking the network as
	active/inactive.

	This has been setup as toplevel Start/Shutdown functions that do the
	small bit of common stuff, then have a switch statement to execute
	network type-specific start/shutdown code, then do a bit more common
	code. The type-specific functions called for the new host bridge and
	macvtap based types are currently empty.

	In the future these functions may actually do something, and we will
	surely add more functions that are similarly patterned. Once
	everything has settled, we can make a table of "sub-driver" function
	pointers for each network type, and store a pointer to that table in
	the network object, then we can replace the switch statements with
	calls to functions in the table.

	The final step in this will be to add a new table (and corresponding
	new functions) for new network types as they are added.

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: support abstracted interface info in network XML
	The network XML is updated in the following ways:

	1) The <forward> element can now contain a list of forward interfaces:

	     <forward .... >
	       <interface dev='eth10'/>
	       <interface dev='eth11'/>
	       <interface dev='eth12'/>
	       <interface dev='eth13'/>
	     </forward>

	   The first of these takes the place of the dev attribute that is
	   normally in <forward> - when defining a network you can specify
	   either one, and on output both will be present. If you specify
	   both on input, they must match.

	2) In addition to forward modes of 'nat' and 'route', these new modes
	   are supported:

	     private, passthrough, vepa - when this network is referenced by a
	     domain's interface, it will have the same effect as if the
	     interface had been defined as type='direct', e.g.:

	        <interface type='direct'>
	          <source mode='${mode}' dev='${dev}>
	          ...
	        </interface>

	     where ${mode} is one of the three new modes, and ${dev} is an interface
	     selected from the list given in <forward>.

	     bridge - if a <forward> dev (or multiple devs) is defined, and
	     forward mode is 'bridge' this is just like the modes 'private',
	     'passthrough', and 'vepa' above. If there is no forward dev
	     specified but a bridge name is given (e.g. "<bridge
	     name='br0'/>"), then guest interfaces using this network will use
	     libvirt's "host bridge" mode, equivalent to this:

	       <interface type='bridge'>
	          <source bridge='${bridge-name}'/>
	          ...
	       </interface>

	3) A network can have multiple <portgroup> elements, which may be
	   selected by the guest interface definition (by adding
	   "portgroup='${name}'" in the <source> element along with the
	   network name). Currently a portgroup can only contain a
	   virtportprofile, but the intent is that other configuration items
	   may be put there int the future (e.g. bandwidth config). When
	   building a guest's interface, if the <interface> XML itself has no
	   virtportprofile, and if the requested network has a portgroup with
	   a name matching the name given in the <interface> (or if one of the
	   network's portgroups is marked with the "default='yes'" attribute),
	   the virtportprofile from that portgroup will be used by the
	   interface.

	4) A network can have a virtportprofile defined at the top level,
	   which will be used by a guest interface when connecting in one of
	   the 'direct' modes if the guest interface XML itself hasn't
	   specified any virtportprofile, and if there are also no matching
	   portgroups on the network.

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: support abstracted interface info in domain interface XML
	the domain XML <interface> element is updated in the following ways:

	1) <virtualportprofile> can be specified when source type='network'
	(previously it was only valid for source type='direct')

	2) A new attribute "portgroup" has been added to the <source>
	element. When source type='network' (the only time portgroup is
	recognized), extra configuration information will be taken from the
	<portgroup> element of the given name in the network definition.

	3) Each virDomainNetDef now also potentially has a
	virDomainActualNetDef which is a private object (never
	exported/imported via the public API, and not defined in the RNG) that
	is used to maintain information about the physical device that was
	actually used for a NetDef of type VIR_DOMAIN_NET_TYPE_NETWORK.

	The virDomainActualNetDef will only be parsed/formatted if the
	parse/format function is called with the
	VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_ACTUAL_NET flag set (which is only needed when
	saving/loading a running domain's state info to the stateDir).

2011-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	conf: virDomainNetDef points to (rather than contains) virtPortProfile
	The virtPortProfile in the domain interface struct is now a separately
	allocated object *pointed to by* (rather than contained in) the main
	virDomainNetDef object. This is done to make it easier to figure out
	when a virtualPortProfile has/hasn't been specified in a particular
	config.

	conf: put virtPortProfile struct / functions in a common location
	virtPortProfiles are currently only used in the domain XML, but will
	soon also be used in the network XML. To prepare for that change, this
	patch moves the structure definition into util/network.h and the parse
	and format functions into util/network.c (I decided that this was a
	better choice than macvtap.h/c for something that needed to always be
	available on all platforms).

	util: define MAX
	If util.h is going to have a MIN, it may as well also have MAX.

	In preparation for a future patch adding new virFile APIs.

	* src/util/files.h, src/util/files.c: Move...
	* src/util/virfile.h, src/util/virfile.c: ...here, and rename
	functions to virFile prefix.  Macro names are intentionally
	left alone.
	* *.c: All '#include "files.h"' uses changed.
	* src/Makefile.am (UTIL_SOURCES): Reflect rename.
	* cfg.mk (exclude_file_name_regexp--sc_prohibit_close): Likewise.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Likewise.
	* docs/hacking.html.in: Likewise.
	* HACKING: Regenerate.

	command: avoid leaking fds across fork
	Since libvirt is multi-threaded, we should use FD_CLOEXEC as much
	as possible in the parent, and only relax fds to inherited after
	forking, to avoid leaking an fd created in one thread to a fork
	run in another thread.  This gets us closer to that ideal, by
	making virCommand automatically clear FD_CLOEXEC on fds intended
	for the child, as well as avoiding a window of time with non-cloexec
	pipes created for capturing output.

	* src/util/command.c (virExecWithHook): Use CLOEXEC in parent.  In
	child, guarantee that all fds to pass to child are inheritable.
	(getDevNull): Use CLOEXEC.
	(prepareStdFd): New helper function.
	(virCommandRun, virCommandRequireHandshake): Use pipe2.
	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c (qemuBuildCommandLine): Simplify caller.

	command: move all docs into .c file
	We already have a precedent of function documentation in C files,
	where it is closer to the implementation (witness libvirt.h vs.
	libvirt.c); maintaining docs in both files risks docs going stale.

	While I was at it, I used consistent doxygen style on all comments.

	* src/util/command.h: Remove duplicate docs, and move unique
	documentation...
	* src/util/command.c: ...here.
	Suggested by Matthias Bolte.

	rpc: Make the dispatch generator handle 'void name(void)' style procedures
	The only 'void name(void)' style procedure in the protocol is 'close' that
	is handled special, but also programming errors like a missing _args or
	_ret suffix on the structs in the .x files can create such a situation by
	accident. Making the generator aware of this avoids bogus errors from the
	generator such as:

	  Use of uninitialized value in exists at ./rpc/gendispatch.pl line 967.

	Also this allows to get rid of the -c option and the special case code for
	the 'close' procedure, as the generator handles it now correctly.

	error: preserve errno when saving last error
	It is common to see the sequence:

	virErrorPtr save_err = virSaveLastError();
	// do cleanup
	virSetError(save_err);
	virFreeError(save_err);

	on cleanup paths.  But for functions where it is desirable to
	return the errno that caused failure, this sequence can clobber
	that errno.  virFreeError was already safe; this makes the other
	two functions in the sequence safe as well, assuming all goes
	well (on OOM, errno will be clobbered, but then again, save_err
	won't reflect the real error that happened, so you are no longer
	preserving the real situation - that's life with OOM).

	* src/util/virterror.c (virSaveLastError, virSetError): Preserve
	errno.

	Commit 8665f85523f0451c changed generated.stamp to $(GENERATE).stamp,

	build in case the generated code is deleted but the .stamp file stays
	around and therefore the code isn't regenerated.

	doc: Add documentation for new cputune elements period and quota
	We have added element period and quota. Document them in formatdomain.html.in.

	qemu: Implement cfs_period and cfs_quota's modification
	This patch implements cfs_period and cfs_quota's modification.
	We can use the command 'virsh schedinfo' to query or modify cfs_period and
	cfs_quota.
	If you query period or quota from config file, the value 0 means it does not set
	in the config file.
	If you set period or quota to config file, the value 0 means that delete current
	setting from config file.
	If you modify period or quota while vm is running, the value 0 means that use
	current value.

	qemu: Implement period and quota tunable XML configuration and parsing
	This patch implements period and quota tunable XML configuration and parsing.
	A quota or period of zero will be simply ignored.

	Update XML Schema for new entries
	Define the element cputune's child elements 'period' and 'quota':
	<cputune>
	  <period>100000</period>
	  <quota>50000</quota>
	</cputune>

	cgroup: Implement cpu.cfs_period_us and cpu.cfs_quota_us tuning API
	This patch provides 4 APIs to get and set cpu.cfs_period_us and cpu.cfs_quota_us.

	Introduce the function virCgroupForVcpu
	Introduce the function virCgroupForVcpu() to create sub directory for each vcpu.

	undefine: Extend virsh undefine to support the new flag
	If the domain has managed save image, and --managed-save is
	not specified, then it fails with an error telling the user
	that a managed save image still exists.

	If the domain has managed save image, and --managed-save is
	specified, it invokes virDomainUndefineFlags. If
	virDomainUndefineFlags fails, then it tries to remove the managed
	save image using virDomainManagedSaveRemove first, with
	invoking virDomainUndefine following. (For compatibility between
	new virsh with this patch and older libvirt without this patch).

	Similarly if the domain has no managed save image. See the codes for
	detail.

	NOTE: Have not removing the codes checking if the domain is running
	in function "cmdUndefine", it will go along with qemu driver's fix
	(allow to undefine a running domain).

2011-07-20  Osier Yang  <jyang@redhat.com>

	undefine: Define the new API
	This introduces a new API virDomainUndefineFlags to control the
	domain undefine process, as the existing API virDomainUndefine
	doesn't support flags.

	Currently only flag VIR_DOMAIN_UNDEFINE_MANAGED_SAVE is supported.
	If the domain has a managed save image, including
	VIR_DOMAIN_UNDEFINE_MANAGED_SAVE in @flags will also remove that
	file, and omitting the flag will cause undefine process to fail.

	This patch also changes the behavior of virDomainUndefine, if the
	domain has a managed save image, the undefine will be refused.

	Add sanity checking of basic constraints, key purpose & key usage
	Gnutls requires that certificates have basic constraints present
	to be used as a CA certificate. OpenSSL doesn't add this data
	by default, so add a sanity check to catch this situation. Also
	validate that the key usage and key purpose constraints contain
	correct data

	* src/rpc/virnettlscontext.c: Add sanity checking of certificate

2011-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add some basic sanity checking of certificates before use
	If the libvirt daemon or libvirt client is configured with bogus
	certificates, it is very unhelpful to only find out about this
	when a TLS connection is actually attempted. Not least because
	the error messages you get back for failures are incredibly
	obscure.

	This adds some basic sanity checking of certificates at the
	time the virNetTLSContext object is created. This is at libvirt
	startup, or when creating a virNetClient instance.

	This checks that the certificate expiry/start dates are valid
	and that the certificate is actually signed by the CA that is
	loaded.

	Add an explicit virNetClientClose method
	Since the I/O callback registered against virNetSocket will
	hold a reference on the virNetClient, we can't rely on the
	virNetClientFree to be able to close the network connection.
	The last reference will only go away when the event callback
	fires (likely due to EOF from the server).

	This is sub-optimal and can potentially cause a leak of the
	virNetClient object if the server were to not explicitly
	close the socket itself

	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Explicitly close the client
	  object when disconnecting

	Use a virFreeCallback on virNetSocket to ensure safe release
	When unregistering an I/O callback from a virNetSocket object,
	there is still a chance that an event may come in on the callback.
	In this case it is possible that the virNetSocket might have been
	freed already. Make use of a virFreeCallback when registering
	the I/O callbacks and hold a reference for the entire time the
	callback is set.

	Unregister event callback if a fatal error occurs during dispatch
	If we get an I/O error in the async event callback for an RPC
	client, we might not have consumed all pending data off the
	wire. This could result in the callback being immediately
	invoked again. At which point the same I/O might occur. And
	we're invoked again. And again...And again...

	Unregistering the async event callback if an error occurs is
	a good safety net. The real error will be seen when the next
	RPC method is invoked

	libvirt: do not mix internal flags into public API
	There were two API in driver.c that were silently masking flags
	bits prior to calling out to the drivers, and several others
	that were explicitly masking flags bits.  This is not
	forward-compatible - if we ever have that many flags in the
	future, then talking to an old server that masks out the
	flags would be indistinguishable from talking to a new server
	that can honor the flag.  In general, libvirt.c should forward
	_all_ flags on to drivers, and only the drivers should reject
	unknown flags.

	In the case of virDrvSecretGetValue, the solution is to separate
	the internal driver callback function to have two parameters
	instead of one, with only one parameter affected by the public
	API.  In the case of virDomainGetXMLDesc, it turns out that
	no one was ever mixing VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS with
	the dumpxml path in the first place; that internal flag was
	only used in saving and restoring state files, which happened
	to be in functions internal to a single file, so there is no
	mixing of the internal flag with a public flags argument.
	Additionally, virDomainMemoryStats passed a flags argument
	over RPC, but not to the driver.

	docs: improve virsh man page synopses
	"optional" is not a very good meta-syntactic construct in our man
	page.  I scrubbed this, and additionally improved some documentation
	on mutually exclusive options.  For example,

	[[--live] [--config] | [--current]]

	implies a set of optional flags, where within the set you can have
	either --current or a choice of 0, 1, or both --live and --config.

	* tools/virsh.pod: Use "[name]" rather than "optional name" for
	optional arguments.

	Fix now dead cleanup of VMs on libvirtd restart
	When libvirtd restarts it will attempt to reconnect to existing
	LXC containers. If it loads a XML state file for the container
	the container will appear running. If we fail to read the PID
	file, or fail to connect to the LXC monitor, we should be killing
	off the guest, but if the VMs cgroup does not exist any more,
	cleanup will get skipped. Reading the PID file is also pointless
	since the PID is in the XML statefile

	In lxcReconnectVM we do not need to read the PID file. If part
	of the reconnect process fails we need to run the VM terminate
	code as a safety net.

	In lxcVMTerminate, if we can't obtain the VM cgroup, we know
	the process has died, but we must still run lxcVMCleanup to
	clear out the virDomainObjPtr live state

	How to reproduce:

	virsh: improve option handling
	The documentation for vshCommandOptString claims that it returns

	that I decided a rewrite would make it easier to understand,

	update apparmor security driver for new udev paths
	In the Ubuntu development release we recently got a new udev that

	This change in udev requires updating the apparmor security driver in
	libvirt[1].

	Attached is a patch that:
	 * adjusts src/security/virt-aa-helper.c to allow both
	LOCALSTATEDIR/run/libvirt/**/%s.pid and /run/libvirt/**/%s.pid. While
	the profile is not as precise, LOCALSTATEDIR/run/ is typically a symlink
	to /run/ anyway, so there is no additional access (remember that
	apparmor resolves symlinks, which is why this is still required even
	if /var/run points to /run).
	 * adjusts example/apparmor/libvirt-qemu paths for /dev/shm

	util: honor anchored names when searching for executables
	I got bit in a debugging session on an uninstalled libvirtd; the
	code tried to call out to the installed $LIBEXECDIR/libvirt_iohelper
	instead of my just-built version.  So I set a breakpoint and altered
	the binary name to be "./src/libvirt_iohelper", and it still failed
	because I don't have "." on my PATH.

	According to POSIX, execvp only searches PATH if the name does
	not contain a slash.  Since we are trying to mimic that behavior,
	an anchored name should be relative to the current working dir.

	This tightens existing behavior, but most callers already pass
	an absolute name or a name with no slashes, so it probably won't
	be noticeable.

	qemu: Add support for job phase

	after libvirtd restarts.

	qemu: Recover from interrupted jobs
	Detect and react on situations when libvirtd was restarted or killed
	when a job was active.

	qemu: Save job type in domain status XML
	If libvirtd is restarted when a job is running, the new libvirtd process
	needs to know about that to be able to recover and rollback the
	operation.

	qemu: Allow all query commands to be run during long jobs
	Query commands are safe to be called during long running jobs (such as
	migration). This patch makes them all work without the need to
	special-case every single one of them.

	The patch introduces new job.asyncCond condition and associated
	job.asyncJob which are dedicated to asynchronous (from qemu monitor
	point of view) jobs that can take arbitrarily long time to finish while
	qemu monitor is still usable for other commands.

	The existing job.active (and job.cond condition) is used all other
	synchronous jobs (including the commands run during async job).

	Locking schema is changed to use these two conditions. While asyncJob is
	active, only allowed set of synchronous jobs is allowed (the set can be
	different according to a particular asyncJob) so any method that
	communicates to qemu monitor needs to check if it is allowed to be
	executed during current asyncJob (if any). Once the check passes, the
	method needs to normally acquire job.cond to ensure no other command is
	running. Since domain object lock is released during that time, asyncJob
	could have been started in the meantime so the method needs to recheck
	the first condition. Then, normal jobs set job.active and asynchronous
	jobs set job.asyncJob and optionally change the list of allowed job
	groups.

	Since asynchronous jobs only set job.asyncJob, other allowed commands
	can still be run when domain object is unlocked (when communicating to
	remote libvirtd or sleeping). To protect its own internal synchronous
	commands, the asynchronous job needs to start a special nested job
	before entering qemu monitor. The nested job doesn't check asyncJob, it
	only acquires job.cond and sets job.active to block other jobs.

	Implement code to attach to external QEMU instances.

	for the process.

	/proc/$PID/exe is resolved to identify the full command

	Do not drop kernel cmdline for xen pv domains
	Kernel cmdline args can be passed to xen pv domains even when a

	ignores cmdline when bootloader is present.

	Since the xend sub-driver is used with many xen toolstack versions,
	this patch takes conservative approach of adding an else block to
	existing !def->os.bootloader, and only appends sxpr if def->os.cmdline
	is non-NULL.

	Fix sending of reply to final RPC message
	The dispatch for the CLOSE RPC call was invoking the method
	virNetServerClientClose(). This caused the client connection
	to be immediately terminated. This meant the reply to the
	final RPC message was never sent. Prior to the RPC rewrite
	we merely flagged the connection for closing, and actually
	closed it when the next RPC call dispatch had completed.

	* daemon/remote.c: Flag connection for a delayed close

	Fix leak of remote driver if final 'CLOSE' RPC call fails
	When closing a remote connection we issue a (fairly pointless)
	'CLOSE' RPC call to the daemon. If this fails we skip all the
	cleanup of private data, but the virConnectPtr object still
	gets released as normal. This causes a memory leak. Since the
	CLOSE RPC call is pretty pointless, just carry on freeing the
	remote driver if it fails.

	Fix release of outgoing stream confirmation/abort message
	When sending back the final OK or ERROR message on completion
	of a stream, we were not decrementing the 'nrequests' tracker
	on the client. With the default requests limit of '5', this
	meant once a client had created 5 streams, they are unable to
	process any further RPC calls.  There was also a bug when
	handling an error from decoding a message length header, which
	meant a client connection would not immediately be closed.

	In one exit path we forgot to free the virNetMessage object causing

	although this was (currently) harmless.

	If a client disconnects while it has a stream active, there is

	util: Don't try to fchown files opened as non-root
	When virFileOpenAs is called with VIR_FILE_OPEN_AS_UID flag and uid/gid
	different from root/root while libvirtd is running as root, we fork a
	new child, change its effective UID/GID to uid/gid and run
	virFileOpenAsNoFork. It doesn't make any sense to fchown() the opened
	file in this case since we already know that uid/gid can access the file
	when open succeeds and one of the following situations may happen:

	- the file is already owned by uid/gid and we skip fchown even before
	  this patch
	- the file is owned by uid but not gid because it was created in a
	  directory with SETGID set, in which case it is desirable not to change
	  the group
	- the file may be owned by a completely different user and/or group
	  because it was created on a root-squashed or even all-squashed NFS
	  filesystem, in which case fchown would most likely fail anyway

	public API: prefer unsigned int for flags
	Most APIs use 'unsigned int flags'; but a few stragglers were using
	a signed value.  In particular, the vir*GetXMLDesc APIs were
	split-brain, with inconsistent choice of types.  Although it is
	an API break to use 'int' instead of 'unsigned int', it is ABI
	compatible (pre-compiled apps will have no difference in behavior),
	and generally apps can be recompiled without any issue (only rare
	apps that compiled with extremely high warning levels, or which
	pass libvirt API around as typed function pointers, would have to
	make any code changes to deal with the change).

	The migrate APIs use 'unsigned long flags', which can't be changed,
	due to ABI constraints.

	This patch intentionally touches only the public API, to prove the
	claim that most existing code (including driver callbacks and virsh)
	still compiles just fine in spite of the type change.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in (virConnectOpenAuth)
	(virDomainCoreDump, virDomainGetXMLDesc, virNetworkGetXMLDesc)

	build: fix virBufferVasprintf on mingw
	Gnulib documents that mingw vsnprintf is broken (it returns -1
	on out-of-space, instead of the count of what would have been
	printed); but while we were using the snprintf wrapper, we had
	not yet been using the vsnprintf wrapper.

	Meanwhile, mingw (but not mingw64) has a replacement snprintf
	that fixes return values, but still lacks %1$s support; so in
	that case, gnulib didn't replace snprintf, but libintl then
	went ahead and installed a version that supported %1$s but not

	Fix default value of security label 'relabel' attribute
	When no <seclabel> is present in the XML, the virDomainSeclabelDef

	Based on Coverity's finding on the previous patch, I audited

	contents of the fd array are unchanged on pipe2() failure.

	* .gnulib: Update to latest, for pipe2 fix.

2011-07-01  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	rpc: avoid freeing uninitialized variable
	Detected by Coverity.  Both are instances of bad things happening

	and virNetSocketNewConnectCommand could close random fds.

	Note: POSIX doesn't guarantee the contents of fd[0] and fd[1]
	after pipe failure: http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=467
	We may need to introduce a virPipe2 wrapper that guarantees
	that on pipe failure, the fds are explicitly set to -1, rather
	than our current state of assuming the fds are unchanged from
	their value prior to the failed pipe call.

	* src/rpc/virnetclient.c (virNetClientNew): Initialize variable.

	Fix potential crash when saving guests
	The qemudDomainSaveFlag method will call EndJob on the 'vm'
	object it is passed in. This can result in the 'vm' object
	being free'd if the last reference is removed. Thus no caller
	of 'qemudDomainSaveFlag' must *ever* reference 'vm' again
	upon return.

	Unfortunately qemudDomainSave and qemuDomainManagedSave
	both call 'virDomainObjUnlock', which can result in a
	crash. This is non-deterministic since it involves a race
	with the monitor I/O thread.

	Fix leak of virStreamPtr object with callback added in fdstream impl
	When adding a callback to an FD stream, we take an extra reference

	network: Don't ignore errors in dnsmasq config file creation

2011-06-29  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	network: Fix dnsmasq hostsfile creation logic and related tests
	networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile was added in 8fa9c2214247 (Apr 2010).
	It has a force flag. If the dnsmasq hostsfile already exists force
	needs to be true to overwrite it. networkBuildDnsmasqArgv sets force
	to false, networkDefine sets it to true. This results in the
	hostsfile being written only in networkDefine in the common case.
	If no error occurred networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile returns true and
	networkBuildDnsmasqArgv adds the --dhcp-hostsfile to the dnsmasq
	command line.

	networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile was changed in 89ae9849f744 (24 Jun 2011)
	to return a new dnsmasqContext instead of reusing one. This change broke
	the logic of the force flag as now networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile returns
	NULL on error, but the early return -- if force was not set and the
	hostsfile exists -- returns 0. This turned the early return in an error
	case and networkBuildDnsmasqArgv didn't add the --dhcp-hostsfile option
	anymore if the hostsfile already exists. It did because networkDefine
	created the hostsfile already.

	Then 9d4e2845d498 fixed the return 0 case in networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile
	but didn't apply the force option correctly to the new addnhosts file.
	Now force doesn't control an early return anymore, but influences the
	handling of the hostsfile context creation and dnsmasqSave is always
	called now. This commit also added test cases that reveal several
	problems. First, the tests now calls functions that try to write the
	dnsmasq config files to disk. If someone runs this tests as root this
	might overwrite actively used dnsmasq config files, this is a no-go. Also
	the tests depend on configure --localstatedir, this needs to be fixed as
	well, because it makes the tests fail when localstatedir is different
	from /var.

	This patch does several things to fix this:

	1) Move dnsmasqContext creation and saving out of networkBuildDnsmasqArgv
	to the caller to separate the command line generation from the config
	file writing. This makes the command line generation testable without the
	risk of interfering with system files, because the tests just don't call
	dnsmasqSave.

	2) This refactoring of networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile makes the force flag
	useless as the saving happens somewhere else now. This fixes the wrong
	usage of the force flag in combination with then newly added addnhosts
	file by removing the force flag.

	3) Adapt the wrong test cases to the correct behavior, by adding the
	missing --dhcp-hostsfile option. Both affected tests contain DHCP host
	elements but missed the necessary --dhcp-hostsfile option.

	4) Rename networkSaveDnsmasqHostsfile to networkBuildDnsmasqHostsfile,
	because it doesn't save the dnsmasqContext anymore.

	5) Move all directory creations in dnsmasq context handling code from
	the *New functions to dnsmasqSave to avoid directory creations in system
	paths in the test cases.

	6) Now that networkBuildDnsmasqArgv doesn't create the dnsmasqContext
	anymore the test case can create one with the localstatedir that is
	expected by the tests instead of the configure --localstatedir given one.

	Fix compilation with systemtap 1.3
	Version 1.3 of <sys/sdt.h> uses this macro

	  #define STAP_CAST(t) (size_t)t

	that breaks like this if t is a function

	  remote.c:1775: error: cast from function call of type 'const char *'
	  to non-matching type 'long unsigned int' [-Wbad-function-cast]

	For that to work it should probably look like this

	  #define STAP_CAST(t) ((size_t)(t))

	In systemtap 1.4 this was completely rewritten.

	Anyway, before commit df0b57a95a767c t was always a variable, but now
	also a function is used here, namely virNetSASLSessionGetIdentity.

	Use an intermediate variable to avoid this problem.

	Support automatic creation of leases for disks in sanlock
	The current sanlock plugin requires a central management
	application to manually add <lease> elements to each guest,
	to protect resources that are assigned to it (eg writable
	disks). This makes the sanlock plugin useless for usage
	in more ad hoc deployment environments where there is no
	central authority to associate disks with leases.

	This patch adds a mode where the sanlock plugin will
	automatically create leases for each assigned read-write
	disk, using a md5 checksum of the fully qualified disk
	path. This can work pretty well if guests are using
	stable disk paths for block devices eg /dev/disk/by-path/XXXX
	symlinks, or if all hosts have NFS volumes mounted in
	a consistent pattern.

	The plugin will create one lockspace for managing disks
	with filename /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock/__LIBVIRT__DISKS__.
	For each VM disks, there will be another file to hold
	a lease /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock/5903e5d25e087e60a20fe4566fab41fd
	Each VM disk lease is usually 1 MB in size. The script
	virt-sanlock-cleanup should be run periodically to remove
	unused lease files from the lockspace directory.

	To make use of this capability the admin will need to do
	several tasks:

	 - Mount an NFS volume (or other shared filesystem)
	   on /var/lib/libvirt/sanlock
	 - Configure 'host_id' in /etc/libvirt/qemu-sanlock.conf
	   with a unique value for each host with the same NFS
	   mount
	 - Toggle the 'auto_disk_leases' parameter in qemu-sanlock.conf

	Technically the first step can be skipped, in which case
	sanlock will only protect against 2 vms on the same host
	using the same disk (or the same VM being started twice
	due to error by libvirt).

	network: add domain to unqualified names defined with <host>
	If a domain name is defined for a network, add the --expand-hosts
	option to the dnsmasq commandline. This results in the domain being
	added to any hostname that is defined in a dns <host> element and
	contains no '.' characters (i.e. it is an "unqualified"
	hostname). Since PTR records are automatically created for any name
	defined in <host>, the result of a PTR request will change from the
	unqualified name to the qualified name.

	This also has the same effect on any hostnames that dnsmasq reads
	from the host's /etc/hosts file.

	(In the case of guest hostnames that were learned by dnsmasq via DHCP
	requests, they were already getting the domain name added on, even
	without --expand-hosts).

	build: rename Vcpupin to VcpuPin
	We already have a public virDomainPinVcpu, which implies that

	vcpupin: add query option to virsh vcpupin command
	This patch teaches "virsh vcpupin" command to query if no list
	is given. Its feature is to show CPU affinity information in more
	reader-friendly way.

	 # virsh vcpupin VM --config
	 VCPU: CPU Affinity
	 ----------------------------------
	    0: 1-6,9-20
	    1: 10
	    2: 5,9-11,15-20
	    3: 1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15

	When cpulist is omitted, vcpu number is optional. When vcpu number is
	provided, information of only specified vcpu is displayed.

	vcpuinfo: add the code to fallback to try new API
	The "virsh vcpuinfo" command results in failure when the target domain

	virDomainGetVcpus API returns error and the target domain is inactive.

	vcpupin: introduce the new libvirt API (virDomainGetVcpupinInfo)
	This patch introduces a new libvirt API (virDomainGetVcpupinInfo),
	as a counterpart to virDomainPinVcpuFlags.

	We can use virDomainGetVcpus API to retrieve CPU affinity information,
	but can't use this API against inactive domains (at least in case of KVM),
	as it lacks a flags parameter.
	The usual thing is to add a new virDomainGetVcpusFlags, but that API name
	is already occupied by the counterpart to virDomainGetMaxVcpus, which
	has a completely different signature.

	The virDomainGetVcpupinInfo is the new API to retrieve CPU affinity
	information of active and inactive domains.  While the usual convention
	is to list an array before its length, this API violates that rule
	in order to be more like virDomainGetVcpus (where maxinfo was doing
	double-duty as the length of two different arrays).

	Move load of AppArmor profile to GenLabel()
	Commit 12317957ecd6c37a2fb16275dcdeeacfe25c517 introduced an incompatible
	architectural change for the AppArmor security driver. Specifically,
	virSecurityManagerSetAllLabel() is now called much later in
	src/qemu/qemu_process.c:qemuProcessStart(). Previously, SetAllLabel() was
	called immediately after GenLabel() such that after the dynamic label (profile
	name) was generated, SetAllLabel() would be called to create and load the
	AppArmor profile into the kernel before qemuProcessHook() was executed. With
	12317957ecd6c37a2fb16275dcdeeacfe25c517, qemuProcessHook() is now called
	before SetAllLabel(), such that aa_change_profile() ends up being called
	before the AppArmor profile is loaded into the kernel (via ProcessLabel() in
	qemuProcessHook()).

	This patch addresses the change by making GenLabel() load the AppArmor
	profile into the kernel after the label (profile name) is generated.
	SetAllLabel() is then adjusted to only reload_profile() and append stdin_fn to
	the profile when it is specified. This also makes the AppArmor driver work
	like its SELinux counterpart with regard to SetAllLabel() and stdin_fn.

	Allow automatic kill of guests when a connection is closed
	If an application is using libvirt + KVM as a piece of its
	internal infrastructure to perform a specific task, it can
	be desirable to guarentee the VM dies when the virConnectPtr
	disconnects from libvirtd. This ensures the app can't leak
	any VMs it was using. Adding VIR_DOMAIN_START_AUTOKILL as
	a flag when starting guests enables this to be done.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: All VIR_DOMAIN_START_AUTOKILL
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Support automatic killing of guests

	Automatically kill target QEMU if migration aborts abnormally
	Migration is a multi-step process

	  1. Begin(src)
	  2. Prepare(dst)
	  3. Perform(src)
	  4. Finish(dst)
	  5. Confirm(src)

	At step 2, a QEMU process is lauched in the destination to
	accept the incoming migration. Occasionally the process
	that is controlling the migration workflow aborts, and fails
	to call step 4, Finish. This leaves a QEMU process running
	on the target (albeit with paused CPUs). Unfortunately because
	step 2 actives a job on the QEMU process, it is unkillable by
	normal means.

	By registering the VM for autokill against the src virConnectPtr
	in step 2, we can ensure that the guest is forcefully killed off
	if the connection is closed without step 4 being invoked

	* src/qemu/qemu_migration.c: Register autokill in PrepareDirect
	  and PrepareTunnel. Unregister autokill on successful run
	  of Finish

	Add infrastructure to automatically destroy guests when a connection closes
	Sometimes it is useful to be able to automatically destroy a guest when
	a connection is closed. For example, kill an incoming migration if
	the client managing the migration dies. This introduces a map between
	guest 'uuid' strings and virConnectPtr objects. When a connection is
	closed, any associated guests are killed off.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Add autokill hash table to qemu driver
	* src/qemu/qemu_process.c, src/qemu/qemu_process.h: Add APIs

	Support reboots with the QEMU driver
	For controlled shutdown we issue a 'system_powerdown' command
	to the QEMU monitor. This triggers an ACPI event which (most)
	guest OS wire up to a controlled shutdown. There is no equiv
	ACPI event to trigger a controlled reboot. This patch attempts
	to fake a reboot.

	 - In qemuDomainObjPrivatePtr we have a bool fakeReboot
	   flag.
	 - The virDomainReboot method sets this flag and then
	   triggers a normal 'system_powerdown'.
	 - The QEMU process is started with '-no-shutdown'
	   so that the guest CPUs pause when it powers off the
	   guest
	 - When we receive the 'POWEROFF' event from QEMU JSON
	   monitor if fakeReboot is not set we invoke the
	   qemuProcessKill command and shutdown continues
	   normally
	 - If fakeReboot was set, we spawn a background thread
	   which issues 'system_reset' to perform a warm reboot
	   of the guest hardware. Then it issues 'cont' to
	   start the CPUs again

	* src/qemu/qemu_command.c: Add -no-shutdown flag if
	  we have JSON support
	* src/qemu/qemu_domain.h: Add 'fakeReboot' flag to

	Introduce generic RPC client objects
	To facilitate creation of new clients using XDR RPC services,

	objects.

	 - virNetClient: Encapsulates a socket connection to a
	   remote RPC server. Handles all the network I/O for
	   reading/writing RPC messages. Delegates RPC encoding
	   and decoding to the registered programs

	 - virNetClientProgram: Handles processing and dispatch
	   of RPC messages for a single RPC (program,version).
	   A program can register to receive async events
	   from a client

	 - virNetClientStream: Handles generic I/O stream
	   integration to RPC layer

	Each new client program now merely needs to define the list of
	RPC procedures & events it wants and their handlers. It does
	not need to deal with any of the network I/O functionality at
	all.

	pull a lot of the libvirtd daemon code into a set of reusable
	objects.

	 * virNetServer: A server contains one or more services which
	   accept incoming clients. It maintains the list of active
	   clients. It has a list of RPC programs which can be used
	   by clients. When clients produce a complete RPC message,
	   the server passes this onto the corresponding program for
	   handling, and queues any response back with the client.

	 * virNetServerClient: Encapsulates a single client connection.
	   All I/O for the client is handled, reading & writing RPC
	   messages.

	 * virNetServerProgram: Handles processing and dispatch of
	   RPC method calls for a single RPC (program,version).
	   Multiple programs can be registered with the server.

	 * virNetServerService: Encapsulates socket(s) listening for
	   new connections. Each service listens on a single host/port,
	   but may have multiple sockets if on a dual IPv4/6 host.

	Each new daemon now merely has to define the list of RPC procedures
	& their handlers. It does not need to deal with any network related
	functionality at all.

	Integrate TLS/SASL directly into the socket APIs
	This extends the basic virNetSocket APIs to allow them to have
	a handle to the TLS/SASL session objects, once established.
	This ensures that any data reads/writes are automagically
	passed through the TLS/SASL encryption layers if required.

	* src/rpc/virnetsocket.c, src/rpc/virnetsocket.h: Wire up
	  SASL/TLS encryption

2011-06-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Generic module for handling SASL authentication & encryption
	This provides two modules for handling SASL

	 * virNetSASLContext provides the process-wide state, currently
	   just a whitelist of usernames on the server and a one time
	   library init call

	 * virNetTLSSession provides the per-connection state, ie the
	   SASL session itself. This also include APIs for providing
	   data encryption/decryption once the session is established

	* src/Makefile.am: Add to libvirt-net-rpc.la
	* src/rpc/virnetsaslcontext.c, src/rpc/virnetsaslcontext.h: Generic
	  SASL handling code

2011-06-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Generic module for handling TLS encryption and x509 certs
	This provides two modules for handling TLS

	 * virNetTLSContext provides the process-wide state, in particular
	   all the x509 credentials, DH params and x509 whitelists
	 * virNetTLSSession provides the per-connection state, ie the
	   TLS session itself.

	The virNetTLSContext provides APIs for validating a TLS session's
	x509 credentials. The virNetTLSSession includes APIs for performing
	the initial TLS handshake and sending/recving encrypted data

	* src/Makefile.am: Add to libvirt-net-rpc.la
	* src/rpc/virnettlscontext.c, src/rpc/virnettlscontext.h: Generic
	  TLS handling code

2011-06-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce a generic object for using network sockets
	Introduces a simple wrapper around the raw POSIX sockets APIs
	and name resolution APIs. Allows for easy creation of client
	and server sockets with correct usage of name resolution APIs
	for protocol agnostic socket setup.

	It can listen for UNIX and TCP stream sockets.

	It can connect to UNIX, TCP streams directly, or indirectly
	to UNIX sockets via an SSH tunnel or external command

	* src/Makefile.am: Add to libvirt-net-rpc.la
	* src/rpc/virnetsocket.c, src/rpc/virnetsocket.h: Generic
	  sockets APIs
	* tests/Makefile.am: Add socket test
	* tests/virnetsockettest.c: New test case
	* tests/testutils.c: Avoid overriding LIBVIRT_DEBUG settings
	* tests/ssh.c: Dumb helper program for SSH tunnelling tests

2011-06-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Provide a simple object for encoding/decoding RPC messages
	This provides a new struct that contains a buffer for the RPC
	message header+payload, as well as a decoded copy of the message
	header. There is an API for applying a XDR encoding & decoding
	of the message headers and payloads. There are also APIs for
	maintaining a simple FIFO queue of message instances.

	Expected usage scenarios are:

	To send a message

	   msg = virNetMessageNew()

	   ...fill in msg->header fields..
	   virNetMessageEncodeHeader(msg)
	   ...loook at msg->header fields to determine payload filter
	   virNetMessageEncodePayload(msg, xdrfilter, data)
	   ...send msg->bufferLength worth of data from buffer

	To receive a message

	   msg = virNetMessageNew()
	   ...read VIR_NET_MESSAGE_LEN_MAX of data into buffer
	   virNetMessageDecodeLength(msg)
	   ...read msg->bufferLength-msg->bufferOffset of data into buffer
	   virNetMessageDecodeHeader(msg)
	   ...look at msg->header fields to determine payload filter
	   virNetMessageDecodePayload(msg, xdrfilter, data)
	   ...run payload processor

	* src/Makefile.am: Add to libvirt-net-rpc.la
	* src/rpc/virnetmessage.c, src/rpc/virnetmessage.h: Internal
	  message handling API.
	* testutils.c, testutils.h: Helper for printing binary differences
	* virnetmessagetest.c: Validate all XDR encoding/decoding

	Defines the basics of a generic RPC protocol in XDR
	This patch defines the basics of a generic RPC protocol in XDR.
	This is wire ABI compatible with the original remote_protocol.x.
	It takes everything except for the RPC calls / events from that
	protocol

	 - The basic header virNetMessageHeader (aka remote_message_header)
	 - The error object virNetMessageError  (aka remote_error)
	 - Two dummy objects virNetMessageDomain & virNetMessageNetwork
	   sadly needed to keep virNetMessageError ABI compatible with
	   the old remote_error

	The RPC protocol supports method calls, async events and
	bidirectional data streams as before

	* src/Makefile.am: Add rules for generating RPC code from
	  protocol & define a new libvirt-net-rpc.la helper library
	* src/rpc/virnetprotocol.x: New generic RPC protocol

	python: events: Fix C->Python handle callback prototype
	If registering our own event loop implementation written in python,
	any handles or timeouts callbacks registered by libvirt C code must
	be wrapped in a python function. There is some argument trickery that
	makes this all work, by wrapping the user passed opaque value in
	a tuple, along with the callback function.

	Problem is, the current setup requires the user's event loop to know
	about this trickery, rather than just treating the opaque value
	as truly opaque.

	python event loop to do things the proper way.

	python: Implement virStreamSend/RecvAll helpers
	Pure python implementation. The handler callbacks have been altered

	requires the handler to return the string data to send rather than
	store the data in a string pointer.

	python: Implement virStreamSend/Recv
	The return values for the python version are different that the C version
	of virStreamSend: on success we return a string, an error raises an exception,
	and if the stream would block we return int(-2). We need to do this

	This patch changes to allow to receive the special keyword 'r' as a cpulist
	parameter of virsh vcpupin command when resetting vcpupin setting.

	If you set the following:

	 # virsh vcpupin VM 0 r

	the vcpu0 will be pinned to all physical cpus.

	vcpupin: improve vcpupin definition of virsh vcpupin
	When using vcpupin command, we have to speficy comma-separated list as cpulist,
	but this is tedious in case the number of phsycal cpus is large.
	This patch improves this by introducing special markup "-" and "^" which are
	similar to XML schema of "cpuset" attribute.

	The example:

	 # virsh vcpupin Guest 0 0-15,^8

	 is identical to

	 # virsh vcpupin Guest 0 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,9,10,11,12,13,14,15

	NOTE: The expression is sequentially evaluated, so "0-15,^8" is not identical
	to "^8,0-15".

	numatune: Support NUMA memory tuning in qemu driver
	Implemented as setting NUMA policy between fork and exec as a hook,
	using libnuma. Only support memory tuning on domain process currently.

	For the nodemask out of range, will report soft warning instead of
	hard error in libvirt layer. (Kernel will be silent as long as one
	of set bit in the nodemask is valid on the host. E.g. For a host
	has two NUMA nodes, kernel will be silent for nodemask "01010101").
	So, soft warning is the only thing libvirt can do, as one might want

	build: fix building error when building without libvirtd
	When building libvirt without libvirtd, we will receive the following error
	message:

	make[3]: Entering directory `/home/wency/rpmbuild/BUILD/libvirt-0.9.2/tools'
	  CC     virsh-virsh.o
	  CC     virsh-console.o

	./src/.libs/libvirt.so: undefined reference to `numa_available'
	./src/.libs/libvirt.so: undefined reference to `numa_max_node'
	collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

	The reason is that: we check numactl only when building qemu driver, and qemu
	driver will not be built when bulding without libvirtd. So with_numactl's
	value is check and we will not link libnuma.so.

	In the other function, we call numa_available() and numa_max_node() only
	when HAVE_NUMACTL is 1. We should do the same check in the function nodeGetMemoryStats().

	apparmor: implement AppArmorSetFDLabel()
	During a savevm operation, libvirt will now use fd migration if qemu
	supports it. When the AppArmor driver is enabled, AppArmorSetFDLabel()
	is used but since this function simply returns '0', the dynamic AppArmor
	profile is not updated and AppArmor blocks access to the save file. This
	patch implements AppArmorSetFDLabel() to get the pathname of the file by
	resolving the fd symlink in /proc, and then gives that pathname to
	reload_profile(), which fixes 'virsh save' when AppArmor is enabled.

	Fix autostart flag when loading running domains
	Drivers load running persistent and transient domain configs before
	inactive persistent domain configs, however only the latter would set a
	domain's autostart flag. This mismatch between the loaded and on-disk
	state could later cause problems with "virsh autostart":

	  # virsh autostart example
	  error: Failed to mark domain example as autostarted
	  error: Failed to create symlink '/etc/libvirt/qemu/autostart/example.xml to '/etc/libvirt/qemu/example.xml': File exists

	This patch ensures the autostart flag is set correctly even when the
	domain is already defined.

	command: avoid double close
	Previously, the parent process opened 'null' to /dev/null, then
	the child process closes 'null' as well as 'childout'.  But if
	childout was set to be null, then this is a double close.  At
	least the double close was confined to the child process after a
	fork, and therefore there is no risk of another thread opening
	an fd of the same value to be bitten by the double close, but it
	is always better to avoid double-close to begin with.

	Additionally, if all three fds were specified, then opening
	'null' was wasted.

	This patch fixes things to lazily open null on the first use,
	then guarantees it gets closed exactly once.

	that of "virsh setmem", "virsh setvcpus", and whatnot.
	When the --config option is specified, the command affects a persistent
	domain, while --live option is specified, it affects a running (live) domain.
	The --current option cannot be used with --config or --live at the same
	time, and when --current is specified, it affects a "current" domain.

	tests: add a test for multi function PCI device

2011-06-13  Wen Congyang  <wency@cn.fujitsu.com>

	support multifunction PCI device
	If qemu supports multi function PCI device, the format of the PCI address passed
	to qemu is "bus=pci.0,multifunction=on,addr=slot.function".

	If qemu does not support multi function PCI device, the format of the PCI address
	passed to qemu is "bus=pci.0,addr=slot".

2011-06-13  Wen Congyang  <wency@cn.fujitsu.com>

	the hotplugged PCI device should use the whole slot
	Hot pluging/unpluging multi PCI device is not supported now. So the function
	of hotplugged PCI device must be 0. When we hot unplug it, we should set release
	all functions in the slot.

	assign the whole slot to the PCI device that has no address
	If user does not specify the PCI address, we should auto assign an unused slot.

	Reimplement qemuDomainPCIAddressReserveSlot(): reserve all functions in the slot
	We will support multi function PCI device. So we should reserve all functions in
	the slot if we want to reserve a slot.

	the key of hash table should include the function value
	We save all used PCI address in the hash table. The key is generated by domain,
	bus and slot now. We will support multi function PCI device, so the key should
	be generated by domain, bus, slot and function.

	prevent hot unplugging multi function PCI device
	We do not support to hot unplug multi function PCI device now. If the device is
	one function of multi function PCI device, we shoul not allow to hot unplugg
	it.

	check whether qemu supports multi function PCI device
	qemu supports multi function PCI device at least version 0.13.0.

	Coverity complained about these intentional fallthrough cases, but

	esx: avoid dead code
	Detected by Coverity.  The beginning of the function already filtered
	out NULL objectContentList as invalid.  Further investigation shows:

	esxVI_RetrieveProperties is generated and returns a list of objects
	that match the given propertyFilterSpec.
	esxVI_LookupObjectContentByType then tests whether the result
	corresponds to the expected occurrence and reports an error otherwise.
	This simplifies the callers of  esxVI_LookupObjectContentByType, but
	due to the missing dereference the check was never performed because
	the code thought that at least one item was obtained. NULL represents
	an empty list. This is a potential segfault fix because callers of
	esxVI_LookupObjectContentByType that specified "required" occurrence
	assume *objectContentList to be non-NULL when
	esxVI_LookupObjectContentByType succeeds.

	* src/esx/esx_vi.c (esxVI_LookupObjectContentByType): Check

	uuid: annotate non-null requirements
	Coverity already saw through a NULL dereference without these

	But clang still benefits (and is easier to run than coverity),
	not to mention that adding this bit of documentation to the code
	may help future developers remember the constraints.

	restrictions, for improved static analysis.

2011-06-08  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	debug: avoid null dereference on uuid lookup api
	Detected by Coverity.  Commit a98d8f0d tried to make uuid debugging
	more robust, but missed some APIs.  And on the APIs that it visited,
	the mere act of preparing the debug message ends up dereferencing
	uuid prior to the null check.  Which means the APIs which are supposed
	to gracefully reject NULL arguments now end up with SIGSEGV.

	* src/libvirt.c (VIR_UUID_DEBUG): New macro.
	(virDomainLookupByUUID, virDomainLookupByUUIDString)
	(virNetworkLookupByUUID, virNetworkLookupByUUIDString)
	(virStoragePoolLookupByUUID, virStoragePoolLookupByUUIDString)
	(virSecretLookupByUUID, virSecretLookupByUUIDString)

2011-06-08  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	python: avoid unlikely sign extension bug
	Detected by Coverity.  cpumap was allocated with a value of
	(unsigned short)*(int), which is an int computation, and then
	promotes to size_t.  On a 64-bit platform, this fails if bit
	32 of the product is set (because of sign extension giving
	a HUGE value to malloc), even though a naive programmer would
	assume that since the first value is unsigned, the product
	is also unsigned and at most 4GB would be allocated.

	Won't bite in practice (the product should never be that large),
	but worth using the right types to begin with, so that we are
	now computing (unsigned short)*(size_t).

	* python/libvirt-override.c (libvirt_virDomainGetVcpus): Use
	correct type.

2011-06-08  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	build: silence coverity false positive
	Similar in nature to commit fd21ecfd, which shut up valgrind.

	sigaction is apparently a nasty interface for analyzer tools,

	coverity gripes about the (unused and non-standard) sa_restorer.

2011-06-08  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	storage: avoid mishandling backing store > 2GB
	Detected by Coverity.  The code was doing math on shifted unsigned
	char (which promotes to int), then promoting that to unsigned long
	during assignment to size.  On 64-bit platforms, this risks sign
	extending values of size > 2GiB.  Bug present since commit
	489fd3 (v0.6.0).

	I'm not sure if a specially-crafted bogus qcow2 image could
	exploit this, although it's probably not possible, since we
	were already checking for the computed results being within
	range of our fixed-size buffer.

	* src/util/storage_file.c (qcowXGetBackingStore): Avoid sign
	extension.

	lxc: Improve guest startup error reporting
	Add a simple handshake with the lxc_controller process so we can detect

	launch, we scrape all output from the logfile and report it to the user.

	lxc: Refactor controller command building
	Arranges things similar to the qemu driver. Will allow us to more easily

2011-06-07  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Avoid virGetVersion failure on specific driver support configurations
	virGetVersion itself doesn't take a virConnectPtr, but in order to obtain
	the hypervisor version against which libvirt was compiled it is used in
	combination with virConnectGetType like this:

	hvType = virConnectGetType(conn)
	virGetVersion(&libVer, hvType, &typeVer)

	When virConnectGetType is called on a remote connection then the remote
	driver returns the type of the underlying driver on the server side, for
	example QEMU. Then virGetVersion compares hvType to a set of strings that
	depend on configure options and returns LIBVIR_VERSION_NUMBER in most
	cases. Now this fails in case libvirt on the client side is just compiled
	with the remote driver enabled only and the server side has the actual
	driver such as the QEMU driver. It just happens to work when the actual
	driver is enabled on client and server side. But that's not always true.
	I noticed this on FreeBSD:

	freebsd# virsh -c qemu+tcp://192.168.178.22/system version
	Compiled against library: libvir 0.9.2
	error: failed to get the library version
	error: this function is not supported by the connection driver: virGetVersion

	This is not FreeBSD specific, happens on Windows as well due to the
	similar driver support configuration. The problem is that virConnectGetType
	returns QEMU, but virGetVersion on the client side only accepts Remote
	as hvType due to all other drivers being disabled on the client side.

	Daniel P. Berrange suggested to get rid of all the conditional code in
	virGetVersion, ignoring the hvType and always setting typeVer to
	LIBVIR_VERSION_NUMBER. virConnectGetVersion is supposed to be used to
	obtain the hypervisor version.

	security driver: ignore EINVAL when chowning an image file
	This fixes:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=702044
	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=709454

	Both of these complain of a failure to use an image file that resides
	on a read-only NFS volume. The function in the DAC security driver
	that chowns image files to the qemu user:group before using them
	already has special cases to ignore failure of chown on read-only file
	systems, and in a few other cases, but it hadn't been checking for
	EINVAL, which is what is returned if the qemu user doesn't even exist
	on the NFS server.

	Since the explanation of EINVAL in the chown man page almost exactly
	matches the log message already present for the case of EOPNOTSUPP,
	I've just added EINVAL to that same conditional.

	Fix auditing of disk hotunplug operations
	The qemuAuditDisk calls in disk hotunplug operations were being
	passed 'ret >= 0', but the code which sets ret to 0 was not yet

	Fix handling of VIR_EVENT_HANDLE_ERROR in QEMU monitor
	Commit 4454a9efc728b91e791b1f14c26ea23a19d57f48 introduced bad
	behaviour on the VIR_EVENT_HANDLE_ERROR condition. This condition
	is only hit when an invalid FD is used in poll() (typically due
	to a double-close bug). The QEMU monitor code was treating this
	condition as non-fatal, and thus libvirt would poll() in a fast
	loop forever burning 100% CPU. VIR_EVENT_HANDLE_ERROR must be
	handled in the same way as VIR_EVENT_HANDLE_HANGUP, killing the
	QEMU instance.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Treat VIR_EVENT_HANDLE_ERROR as EOF

	Add call to sanlock_restrict() in QEMU lock driver
	In between fork and exec, a connection to sanlock is acquired
	and the socket file descriptor is intionally leaked to the
	child process. sanlock watches this FD for POLL_HANGUP to
	detect when QEMU has exited. We don't want a rogus/compromised
	QEMU from issuing sanlock RPC calls on the leaked FD though,
	since that could be used to DOS other guests. By calling
	sanlock_restrict() on the socket before exec() we can lock
	it down.

	Support passing QEMU lock state to dest during migration
	Some lock managers associate state with leases, allowing a process
	to temporarily release its leases, and re-acquire them later, safe
	in the knowledge that no other process has acquired + released the
	leases in between.

	This is already used between suspend/resume operations, and must
	also be used across migration. This passes the lockstate in the
	migration cookie. If the lock manager uses lockstate, then it
	becomes compulsory to use the migration v3 protocol to get the
	cookie support.

	Integrate the QEMU driver with the lock manager infrastructure
	The QEMU integrates with the lock manager instructure in a number
	of key places

	 * During startup, a lock is acquired in between the fork & exec
	 * During startup, the libvirtd process acquires a lock before
	   setting file labelling
	 * During shutdown, the libvirtd process acquires a lock
	   before restoring file labelling
	 * During hotplug, unplug & media change the libvirtd process
	   holds a lock while setting/restoring labels

	The main content lock is only ever held by the QEMU child process,
	or libvirtd during VM shutdown. The rest of the operations only
	require libvirtd to hold the metadata locks, relying on the active
	QEMU still holding the content lock.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h,

	Support leases in guest XML and lock manager
	A lock manager may operate in various modes. The direct mode of
	operation is to obtain locks based on the resources associated
	with devices in the XML. The indirect mode is where the app
	creating the domain provides explicit leases for each resource
	that needs to be locked. This XML extension allows for listing
	resources in the XML

	  <devices>
	     ...
	     <lease>
	       <lockspace>somearea</lockspace>
	       <key>thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog</key>
	       <target path='/some/lease/path' offset='23432'/>
	     </lease>
	     ...
	  </devices>

	The 'lockspace' is a unique identifier for the lockspace which
	the lease is associated

	The 'key' is a unique identifier for the resource associated
	with the lease.

	The 'target' is the file on disk where the leases are held.

	Allow handshake with child process during startup
	Allow the parent process to perform a bi-directional handshake
	with the child process during fork/exec. The child process
	will fork and do its initial setup. Immediately prior to the
	exec(), it will stop & wait for a handshake from the parent
	process. The parent process will spawn the child and wait
	until the child reaches the handshake point. It will do
	whatever extra setup work is required, before signalling the
	child to continue.

	The implementation of this is done using two pairs of blocking
	pipes. The first pair is used to block the parent, until the
	child writes a single byte. Then the second pair pair is used
	to block the child, until the parent confirms with another
	single byte.

	build: avoid corrupting / in RHEL 5
	I noticed this while building from libvirt.git on RHEL 5.6:

	Generating internals/command.html.tmp
	mkdir: cannot create directory `/internals': Permission denied

	If I had been building as root instead, this pollutes /.

	Older autoconf lacks $(builddir), but it is rigorously equal to '.'
	in newer autoconf, so we could use '$(MKDIR_P) internals' instead.

	However, since internals/command.html is part of the tarball, we
	_already_ build it in $(srcdir), not $(builddir) during VPATH
	builds, so the mkdir is wasted effort!

	openvz: Handle getline failures in openvzReadConfigParam properly
	The regression fix in 3aab7f2d6b068f0 altered the error handling.

	APIs. The virError is stored against the qemuMonitorPtr struct,
	and when a monitor API is run, any existing stored error is copied
	into that thread's error local

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Use

2011-05-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't kill QEMU process when a monitor I/O parsing error occurs
	Currently whenever there is any failure with parsing the monitor,
	this is treated in the same was as end-of-file (ie QEMU quit).
	The domain is terminated, if not already dead.

	With this change, failures in parsing the monitor stream do not
	result in the death of QEMU. The guest continues running unchanged,
	but all further use of the monitor will be disabled.

	The VMM_FAILURE event will be emitted, and the mgmt application
	can decide when to kill/restart the guest to re-gain control

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Run a
	  different callback for monitor EOF vs error conditions.

	  fails

2011-05-29  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce a new event emitted when a virtualization failure occurs
	This introduces a new domain

	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_CONTROL_ERROR

	Which uses the existing generic callback

	typedef void (*virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback)(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                                     virDomainPtr dom,
	                                                     void *opaque);

	This event is intended to be emitted when there is a failure in
	some part of the domain virtualization system. Whether the domain
	continues to run/exist after the failure is an implementation
	detail specific to the hypervisor.

	The idea is that with some types of failure, hypervisors may
	prefer to leave the domain running in a "degraded" mode of
	operation. For example, if something goes wrong with the QEMU
	monitor, it is possible to leave the guest OS running quite
	happily. The mgmt app will simply loose the ability todo various
	tasks. The mgmt app can then choose how/when to deal with the
	failure that occured.

	interface: Implement driver methods for network config transaction API

2011-05-28  Michal Privoznik  <mprivozn@redhat.com>

	interface: new public API for network config change transactions
	This is the API agreed on in:

	  https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2011-May/msg00026.html

	(with a slight name change to use "...begin" rather than
	"...start"). This implements transactional changes to the host network
	config. When a transaction is begun with ncf_change_begin(), all other
	netcf APIs will continue to work as they always have, but a snapshot
	of the existing config will be taken, allowing reversion (rollback,
	using ncf_change_rollback()) to the exact state of config at the time
	ncf_change_begin() was called. Alternately, if it's determined that
	the new changes are acceptable, ncf_change_commit() can be called,
	which will eliminate the snapshot and make the changes permanent.

	As a failsafe measure, if neither ncf_change_commit() or
	ncf_change_rollback() is called by the next time the system reboots,
	the netcf-transaction initscript will be automatically called to
	rollback the changes.

	Fix preservation of errors across migration steps
	When doing migration, if an error occurs in Perform, it must not
	be overwritten during Finish/Confirm steps. If an error occurs
	in Finish, it must not be overwritten in Confirm.

	Previous commit a9d12c2444e43a0d3e5135eb15b4b62a7c011427 added
	code to qemudDomainMigrateFinish2 to preserve the error. This
	is not the right place, because it is not applicable in non-p2p
	migration. The src/libvirt.c virDomainMigrateV2/3 methods need
	code to preserve errors for non-p2p migration, while the
	doPeer2PeerMigrate2 and doPeer2PeerMigrate3 methods contain
	code to preverse errors for p2p migration.

	Remove the bogus error preservation from qemudDomainMigrateFinish2
	and qemudDomainMigrateFinish3.

	Fix virDomainMigrateV3 and doPeer2PeerMigrate3 so that they
	preserve any error hit during the Finish3 step, before invoking
	Confirm3.

	Finally if qemuMigrationFinish fails to resume the CPUs, it must
	preserve the error before tearing down the VM, so that VM cleanup
	doesn't overwrite it.

	Fix SPICE seamless migration hostname
	The SPICE seamless migration process requires data to be passed

	Introduce two method migration APIs
	There are two pieces of information which are desirable for
	migration, which cannot be supplied by applications

	 - The explicit QEMU migration URI, while using Peer2Peer
	   migration
	 - An override for the target VM XML

	This introduces two new public APIs to support these extra
	parameters. There is no need for extra wire protocool changes,
	since this is supported by the v3 migration enhancements

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in,
	  src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_public.syms: Add virDomainMigrate2
	  and virDomainMigrateToURI2

2011-05-25  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add a second URI parameter to virDomainMigratePerform3 method
	The virDomainMigratePerform3 currently has a single URI parameter
	whose meaning varies. It is either

	 - A QEMU migration URI (normal migration)
	 - A libvirtd connection URI (peer2peer migration)

	Unfortunately when using peer2peer migration, without also
	using tunnelled migration, it is possible that both URIs are
	required.

	This adds a second URI parameter to the virDomainMigratePerform3
	method, to cope with this scenario. Each parameter how has a fixed
	meaning.

	NB, there is no way to actually take advantage of this yet,
	since virDomainMigrate/virDomainMigrateToURI do not have any
	way to provide the 2 separate URIs

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.x, src/remote_protocol-structs: Add
	  the second URI parameter to perform3 message

2011-05-25  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Extend v3 migration protocol to allow app supplied XML for target
	This extends the v3 migration protocol such that the
	virDomainMigrateBegin3 and virDomainMigratePerform3
	methods accept an application supplied XML config for
	the target VM.

	If the 'xmlin' parameter is NULL, then Begin3 uses the
	current guest XML as normal. A driver implementing the
	Begin3 method should either reject all non-NULL 'xmlin'
	parameters, or strictly validate that the app supplied
	XML does not change guest ABI.

	The Perform3 method also needed the xmlin parameter to
	cope with the Peer2Peer migration sequence.

	NB it is not yet possible to use this capability since
	neither of the public virDomainMigrate/virDomainMigrateToURI
	methods have a way to pass in XML.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.x, src/remote_protocol-structs:

	The cur_vcpus member of struct libxl_domain_build_info was incorrectly
	initialized to the number of vcpus, when it should have been interpreted
	as a bitmap, where bit X corresponds to online/offline status of vcpuX.

	To complicate matters, cur_vcpus is an int, so only 32 vcpus can be

	virsh: optimize creation of default connection
	Ramon de Carvalho Valle reported a problem with:
	virsh connect qemu:///system
	as a non-root user.  The real root problem appears to be a regression
	in libvirtd being auto-started on the default qemu:///session URI;
	however, the symptom points to an independent flaw in virsh - we
	shouldn't be wasting efforts on making a connection if we aren't going
	to be using that connection.  Fixing virsh avoids Ramon's issue, while
	I work in the meantime to fix the real libvirtd regression.

	This patch looks big, but that's because 'gcc -Wmissing-field-initializers'
	gets triggered by './autobuild.sh --enable-compile-warnings=error', so I
	had to add 0 initialization to everyone (rather than my preference of
	just adding the non-zero flags to virshCmds and to cmdConnect).

	Meanwhile, if you use 'virsh -c URI', the connection must succeed; this
	patch _only_ optimizes the default connection to be deferred to a later
	point where we know if a particular command to be run needs a connection.

	is no fixed limit, and requires ERANGE errors to track real size.
	Model our behavior after the example in POSIX itself:
	http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getpwuid_r.html

	Also, on error for get*_r functions, errno is undefined, and the
	real error was the return value.

	* src/util/util.c (virGetUserEnt, virGetUserID, virGetGroupID)
	(virSetUIDGID):  Cope with sysconf failure or too small buffer.

	Refactor tunnelled migration methods
	To facilitate the introduction of the v3 migration protocol,
	the doTunnelMigrate method is refactored into two pieces. One
	piece is intended to mirror the flow of virDomainMigrateVersion2,
	while the other is the helper for setting up sockets and processing
	the data.

	Previously socket setup would be done before the 'prepare' step,
	so errors could be dealt with immediately, avoiding need to shut
	off the destination QEMU. In the new split, socket setup is done
	after the 'prepare' step. This is not a serious problem, since
	the control flow already requires calling 'finish' to tear down
	the destination QEMU upon several errors.

	Introduce migration cookies to QEMU driver
	The migration protocol has support for a 'cookie' parameter which
	is an opaque array of bytes as far as libvirt is concerned. Drivers
	may use this for passing around arbitrary extra data they might
	need during migration. The QEMU driver needs to do a few things:

	 - Pass hostname/uuid to allow strict protection against localhost
	   migration attempts
	 - Pass SPICE/VNC server port from the target back to the source to
	   allow seamless relocation of client sessions
	 - Pass lock driver state from source to destination

	This patch introduces the basic glue for handling cookies
	but only includes the host/guest UUID & name.

	Introduce yet another migration version in API.
	Migration just seems to go from bad to worse. We already had to
	introduce a second migration protocol when adding the QEMU driver,
	since the one from Xen was insufficiently flexible to cope with
	passing the data the QEMU driver required.

	It turns out that this protocol still has some flaws that we
	need to address. The current sequence is

	 *  Src: DumpXML
	          - Generate XML to pass to dst

	 *  Dst: Prepare
	          - Get ready to accept incoming VM
	          - Generate optional cookie to pass to src

	 *  Src: Perform
	          - Start migration and wait for send completion
	          - Kill off VM if successful, resume if failed

	 *  Dst: Finish
	          - Wait for recv completion and check status
	          - Kill off VM if unsuccessful

	The problems with this are:

	 - Since the first step is a generic 'DumpXML' call, we can't
	   add in other migration specific data. eg, we can't include
	   any VM lease data from lock manager plugins
	 - Since the first step is a generic 'DumpXML' call, we can't
	   emit any 'migration begin' event on the source, or have
	   any hook that runs right at the start of the process
	 - Since there is no final step on the source, if the Finish
	   method fails to receive all migration data & has to kill
	   the VM, then there's no way to resume the original VM
	   on the source

	This patch attempts to introduce a version 3 that uses the
	improved 5 step sequence

	 *  Src: Begin
	          - Generate XML to pass to dst
	          - Generate optional cookie to pass to dst

	 *  Dst: Prepare
	          - Get ready to accept incoming VM
	          - Generate optional cookie to pass to src

	 *  Src: Perform
	          - Start migration and wait for send completion
	          - Generate optional cookie to pass to dst

	 *  Dst: Finish
	          - Wait for recv completion and check status
	          - Kill off VM if failed, resume if success
	          - Generate optional cookie to pass to src

	 *  Src: Confirm
	          - Kill off VM if success, resume if failed

	The API is designed to allow both input and output cookies
	in all methods where applicable. This lets us pass around
	arbitrary extra driver specific data between src & dst during
	migration. Combined with the extra 'Begin' method this lets
	us pass lease information from source to dst at the start of
	migration

	Moving the killing of the source VM out of Perform and
	into Confirm, means we can now recover if the dst host
	can't successfully Finish receiving migration data.

	    qemudDomainDestroy, /* domainDestroy */

	     .listDefinedPools   = NULL,
	     .findPoolSources    = NULL,

	domain: Require <init> for container guests
	Use capabilities to allow a driver to register a default <init> if none
	is specified in the XML. Openvz was already open-coding this to be /sbin/init

	LXC currently falls over if no init is specified, so an explicit error is
	an improvement IMO.

	(Side note: I don't think we can set a default value for LXC. If we use
	/sbin/init but the user doesn't specify a separate root FS for their guest,
	the container will rerun the host's init which can be traumatic :). For
	virt-install I'm thinking of defaulting to /sbin/init if a root FS has
	been specified, otherwise require the user to manually specify <init>)

	fix xdr detection and use with recent glibc
	glibc 2.13.90 has obsoleted its rpc implementation in favour of
	the one provided by the TI-RPC library:

	> * The RPC implementation in libc is obsoleted.  Old programs keep working
	>   but new programs cannot be linked with the routines in libc anymore.
	>   Programs in need of RPC functionality must be linked against TI-RPC.
	>   The TI-RPC implemtation is IPv6 enabled and there are other benefits.
	>
	>   Visible changes of this change include (obviously) the inability to
	>   link
	>   programs using RPC functions without referencing the TI-RPC library,
	>   the
	>   removal of the RPC headers from the glibc headers, and the lack of
	>   symbols defined in <rpc/netdb.h> when <netdb.h> is installed.
	>   Implemented by Ulrich Drepper.
	(from glibc NEWS)

	Thus with recent glibc, we need to try linking with -ltirpc when looking
	for the XDR functions. The daemon also needs to use XDR_CFLAGS to be able
	to find the XDR headers stored in /usr/include/tirpc.

	When using TI-RPC, there are some warnings about redundant declarations, but
	the fix probably belongs in other modules:

	/usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpcent.h:68:13: warning: redundant redeclaration of
	'setrpcent' [-Wredundant-decls]
	/usr/include/rpc/netdb.h:53:13: note: previous declaration of 'setrpcent'
	was here

	/usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpcent.h:69:13: warning: redundant redeclaration of
	'endrpcent' [-Wredundant-decls]
	/usr/include/rpc/netdb.h:54:13: note: previous declaration of 'endrpcent'
	was here

	/usr/include/tirpc/rpc/rpc.h:84:12: warning: redundant redeclaration of
	'bindresvport' [-Wredundant-decls]

	build: avoid gcc preprocessor extensions
	Use of ',##__VA_ARGS__' is a gcc extension not guaranteed by

	(VIR_ERROR_INT, VIR_DEBUG, VIR_INFO, VIR_WARN, VIR_ERROR): Stick

	libvirt,logging: cleanup VIR_XXX0()
	These VIR_XXXX0 APIs make us confused, use the non-0-suffix APIs instead.

	How do these coversions works? The magic is using the gcc extension of ##.
	When __VA_ARGS__ is empty, "##" will swallow the "," in "fmt," to
	avoid compile error.

	example: origin				after CPP
		high_level_api("%d", a_int)	low_level_api("%d", a_int)
		high_level_api("a  string")	low_level_api("a  string")

	About 400 conversions.

	8 special conversions:
	VIR_XXXX0("") -> VIR_XXXX("msg") (avoid empty format) 2 conversions
	VIR_XXXX0(string_literal_with_%) -> VIR_XXXX(%->%%) 0 conversions
	VIR_XXXX0(non_string_literal) -> VIR_XXXX("%s", non_string_literal)
	  (for security) 6 conversions

	xen: parse and generate hpet item in sxpr
	Recent versions of Xen disable the virtual HPET by default.  This is

	the HPET manually: 1) to test the emulation; 2) because distros may
	provide the knob while leaving the default to "enabled" for compatibility
	reasons.

	This patch provides support for the hpet item in both sexpr and xm

	remote: Replace 'domain' with 'dom' in the XDR protocol
	This simplifies the remote protocol code generator.

	Also rename 'ret' to 'result' to resolve a naming conflict in the
	generator.

	remote generator, daemon: Output function bodies too
	This patch just covers the simple functions without explicit return
	values. There is more to be handled.

	The generator collects the members of the XDR argument structs and uses
	this information to generate the function bodies.

	Exclude the generated files from offending syntax-checks.

	Suggested by Richard W.M. Jones

	Balloon dom0 in libxl driver
	Creating a domU on a freshly booted dom0 does not work,
	because the libxl driver does not allocate memory for the domU.
	After creating a domain with xl libvirt is able to create domains too.
	This patch reserves enough memory for the domU first.

	build: drop files generated by config.status from tarball
	The rule of thumb is that any file generated by config.status
	is a) reproducible by any user, b) dependent on configure options.
	Therefore, it is inappropriate to include such generated files
	in the tarball (for proof, Makefile is generated from Makefile.in;
	the former is not in the tarball while the latter is).

	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove files covered by AC_OUTPUT.

	maint: rename virBufferVSprintf to virBufferAsprintf
	We already have virAsprintf, so picking a similar name helps for
	seeing a similar purpose.  Furthermore, the prefix V before printf
	generally implies 'va_list', even though this variant was '...', and
	the old name got in the way of adding a new va_list version.

	global rename performed with:

	$ git grep -l virBufferVSprintf \
	  | xargs -L1 sed -i 's/virBufferVSprintf/virBufferAsprintf/g'

	then revert the changes in ChangeLog-old.

	remote: avoid null dereference on error
	Clang found three instances of uninitialized use of nparams in
	the cleanup path.  Unfortunately, one is a false positive: clang
	couldn't see that ret->params.params_val is guaranteed to be
	NULL unless allocated within a function, and that nparams is
	guaranteed to be assigned prior to the allocation; hoisting the
	assignment to nparams to be earlier in the function shuts up
	that false positive.  But two of the reports also happened to
	highlight a real bug - the error path can dereference NULL.

	Regression introduced in commit 158ba873.

	* daemon/remote.c (remoteDispatchDomainGetMemoryParameters)
	(remoteDispatchDomainGetBlkioParameters): Don't clear fields if
	array was not allocated.
	(remoteDispatchDomainGetSchedulerParameters): Initialize nparams
	earlier.

	qemu: update qemuCgroupControllerActive signature
	Clang warned about a dead assignment.  In the process, I noticed

	cgroup: avoid leaking a file
	Clang detected a dead store to rc.  It turns out that in fixing this,
	I also found a FILE* leak.

	This is a subtle change in behavior, although unlikely to hit.  The
	pidfile is a kernel file, so we've probably got more serious problems
	under foot if we fail to parse one.  However, the previous behavior
	was that even if one pid file failed to parse, we tried others,
	whereas now we give up on the first failure.  Either way, though,
	the function returns -1, so the caller will know that something is
	going wrong, and that not all pids were necessarily reaped.  Besides,
	there were other instances already in the code where failure in the
	inner loop aborted the outer loop.

	* src/util/cgroup.c (virCgroupKillInternal): Abort rather than
	resuming loop on fscanf failure, and cleanup file on error.

	Clang 2.8 wasn't quite able to follow that persistentDef was

	qemu: avoid null pointer dereference
	This code has had problems historically.  As originally

	on a random string, nuking an unrelated file.

	Then commit 182a80b9 (Sep 09), the code was rewritten to
	allocate tmp, with both a use-after-free bug and a chance to
	call unlink(NULL).

	Commit e206946 (Mar 11) fixed the use-after-free, but not the
	NULL dereference.  Thanks to clang for catching this!

	Xen: Do not generate net ifname if domain is inactive
	V2: Use virAsprintf instead of snprintf/strdup

	The xend driver will generate a virDomainNetDef ifname if one is not
	specified in xend sexpr, even if domain is inactive.  The result is
	network interface XML containing 'vif-1.Y' on dev attribute of target
	element, e.g.

	  <interface type='bridge'>
	    <target dev='vif-1.0'/>
	    ...

	This patch changes the behavior to only generate the ifname if not
	specified in xend sexpr *and* domain is not inactive (id != -1).

	xen: check if device is assigned to guest before reattaching
	Bugzilla: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664059

	Reattaching pci device back to host without destroying guest or
	detaching device from guest would cause host to crash. This patch adds
	a check before doing device reattach. If the device is being assigned
	to guest, libvirt refuses to reattach device to host. The patch only
	works for Xen, for it just checks xenstore to get pci device
	information.

	fix virsh's regression
	This patch does the following things:
	1. The return value of cmdSchedInfoUpdate() can be -1, 0 and 1. So the
	   type of return value should be int not bool.(This function is not a
	   entry of a virsh command, but the name of this function likes cmdXXX)

	2. The type of cmdSchedinfo()'s, cmdFreecell()'s, cmdPoolList()'s and
	   cmdVolList()'s return value is bool not int, so change the type of
	   variable ret_val, func_ret and functionReturn.

	3. Add a variable functionReturn for cmdMigrate(), cmdAttachInterface(),
	   cmdDetachInterface(), cmdAttachDisk() and cmdDetachDisk() to save the
	   return value.

	4. Change the type of variable ret in the function cmdAttachDevice(),
	   cmdDetachDevice(), cmdUpdateDevice(), cmdAttachInterface(),
	   cmdDetachInterface(), cmdAttachDisk() and cmdDetachDisk() to int, as
	   we use it to save the return value of virXXX() and the type of virXXX()'s
	   return value is int not bool.

	5. Do some cleanup when virBuff.error is 1.

	The bug 1-4 were introduced by commit b56fa5bb.

	util: Simplify hash implementation
	So far first entries for each hash key are stored directly in the hash
	table while other entries mapped to the same key are linked through

	This patch makes all entries (even the first ones) linked through

	release PCI address only when we have ensured it successfully
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	1. # cat net.xml # 00:03.0 has been used
	    <interface type='network'>
	      <mac address='52:54:00:04:72:f3'/>
	      <source network='default'/>
	      <address type='pci' domain='0x0000' bus='0x00' slot='0x03' function='0x0'/>

	2. # virsh attach-device vm1 net.xml
	   error: Failed to attach device from net.xml
	   error: internal error unable to reserve PCI address 0:0:3

	3. # virsh attach-device vm1 net.xml
	   error: Failed to attach device from net.xml
	   error: internal error unable to execute QEMU command 'device_add': Device 'rtl8139' could not be initialized

	The reason of this bug is that: we can not reserve PCI address 0:0:3 because it has
	been used, but we release PCI address when we reserve it failed.

	esx: Fix dynamic dispatch for CastFromAnyType functions
	This was broken by the refactoring in ac1e6586ec75. It resulted in a
	segfault for 'virsh vol-dumpxml' and related volume functions.

	Before the refactoring all users of the ESX_VI__TEMPLATE__DISPATCH
	macro dispatched on the item type, as the item is the input to all those
	functions.

	Commit ac1e6586ec75 made the dynamically dispatched CastFromAnyType
	functions use this macro too, but this functions dispatched on the
	actual type of the AnyType object. The item is the output of the
	CastFromAnyType functions.

	This difference was missed in the refactoring, making CastFromAnyType
	functions dereferencing the item pointer that is NULL at the time of
	the dispatch.

	build: make VIR_FREE do some type checking

	158ba873 and 802e2df, we would have had this warning:

	cc1: warnings being treated as errors
	remote.c: In function 'remoteDispatchListNetworks':
	remote.c:3684:70: error: pointer/integer type mismatch in conditional expression

	There are still a number of places that malloc into a const char*;
	while it would probably be worth scrubbing them to use char*
	instead, that is a separate patch, so we have to cast away const
	in VIR_FREE for now.

	Fix checking of return codes in dispatcher
	The libvirt APIs reserve any negative value for indicating an
	error. Thus checks

	    if (virXXXX() == -1)

	Should instead be

	    if (virXXXX() < 0)

	* daemon/remote.c: s/ == -1/ < 0/

2011-04-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Merge all returns paths from dispatcher into single path
	The dispatcher functions have numerous places where they
	return to the caller. This leads to duplicated cleanup
	code, often resulting in memory leaks. It makes it harder
	to ensure that errors are dispatched before freeing objects,
	which may overwrite the original error.

	The standard pattern is now

	    remoteDispatchXXX(...) {
	        int rv = -1;

	        ....
	        if (XXX < 0)
	          goto cleanup;
	        ...
	        if (XXXX < 0)
	          goto cleanup;
	        ...

	        rv = 0;
	    cleanup:
	        if (rv < 0)
	           remoteDispatchError(rerr);
	        ...free all other stuff..
	        return rv;
	    }

	* daemon/remote.c: Centralize all cleanup paths
	* daemon/stream.c: s/remoteDispatchConnError/remoteDispatchError/
	* daemon/dispatch.c, daemon/dispatch.h: Replace
	  remoteDispatchConnError with remoteDispatchError

	Experimental libvirtd upstart job
	To install it, disable libvirtd sysv initscript:
	    chkconfig libvirtd off
	    service libvirtd stop

	and enable libvirtd upstart job:
	    cp  /usr/share/doc/libvirt-*/libvirtd.upstart \
	        /etc/init/libvirtd.conf
	    initctl reload-configuration
	    initctl start libvirtd

	Test:
	    initctl status libvirtd
	libvirtd start/running, process 3929
	    killall -9 libvirtd
	    initctl status libvirtd
	libvirtd start/running, process 4047

	I looked into the possibility to use the upstart script from Ubuntu or
	at least getting inspiration from it but that's not possible. "expect
	daemon" is a nice thing but it only works if the process is defined with
	exec stanza instead of script ... no script. Unfortunately, with exec
	stanza environment variables can only be set within upstart script
	(i.e., configuration in /etc/sysconfig/libvirtd can't work). Hence, we
	need to use script stanza, source sysconfig, and execute libvirtd
	without --daemon. For similar reasons we can't use limit stanza and need
	to handle DAEMON_COREFILE_LIMIT in job's script.

	enhance processWatchdogEvent()
	This patch does the following two things:
	1. hold an extra reference while handling watchdog event
	   If the domain is not persistent, and qemu quits unexpectedly before
	   calling processWatchdogEvent(), vm will be freed and the function
	   processWatchdogEvent() will be dangerous.

	2. unlock qemu driver and vm before returning from processWatchdogEvent()
	   When the function processWatchdogEvent() failed, we only free wdEvent,
	   but forget to unlock qemu driver and vm, free dumpfile.

	virsh: fix regression in parsing optional integer
	Regression introduced in 0.8.5, commit c1564268.  The command
	'virsh freecell 0' quit working when it changed from an optional
	string to an optional integer.

	This patch introduces a slight change that specifying an option
	twice is now detected as an error.  It also changes things so
	that a command that has more than 1 required option will not
	complain about missing options if one but not all of the options
	were given in long format, as in 'virsh vol-create --pool p file',
	as well as making positional parsing work for all optional
	options (each positional argument is associated with the earliest
	option that has not yet been seen by name).

	Optional boolean options can appear before required argument
	options, because they don't affect positional argument parsing,
	and obviously a required boolean option makes no sense.

	Technically, this patch renders VSH_OT_STRING and VSH_OT_DATA
	redundant; but cleaning that up can be a separate patch.

	No command should ever need more than 32 options, right? :)

	* tools/virsh.c (vshCmddefGetData, vshCmddefGetOption)
	(vshCommandCheckOpts): Alter parameters to use bitmaps.
	(vshCmddefOptParse): New function.
	(vshCommandParse): Update for better handling of positional
	arguments.
	(vshCmddefHelp): Allow unit tests to validate options.

2011-04-16  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	virsh: list required options first
	The current state of virsh parsing is that:

	$ virsh vol-info /path/to/image
	$ virsh vol-info --pool default /path/to/image
	$ virsh vol-info --pool default --vol /path/to/image

	all lookup the volume by path (technically, the last two also attempt
	a name lookup within a pool, whereas the first skips that step, but
	the end result is the same); meanwhile:

	$ virsh vol-info default /path/to/image

	complains about unexpected data.  Why?  Because the --pool option is
	optional, so default was parsed as the --vol argument, and
	/path/to/image.img doesn't match up with any remaining options that
	require an argument.  For proof, note that:

	$ virsh vol-info default --vol /path/to/image

	complains about looking up 'default' - the parser mis-associated both
	arguments with --vol.  Given the above, the only way to specify pool
	is with an explicit "--pool" argument (you can't specify it
	positionally).  However, named arguments can appear in any order, so:

	$ virsh vol-info /path/to/image --pool default
	$ virsh vol-info --vol /path/to/image --pool default

	have also always worked.  Therefore, this patch has no functional
	change on vol-info option parsing, but only on 'virsh help vol-info'
	synopsis layout.  However, it also allows the next patch to 1) enforce
	that required options are always first (without this patch, the next
	patch would fail the testsuite), and 2) allow the user to omit the
	"--pool" argument.  That is, the next patch makes it possible to do:

	$ virsh vol-info /path/to/image default

	which to date was not possible.

	(opts_vol_path): List optional pool parameter after required
	arguments.

	network: truncate bridges' dummy tap device names to IFNAMSIZ (15) chars
	This patch addresses:

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=694382

	In order to give each libvirt-created bridge a fixed MAC address,
	commit 5754dbd56d4738112a86776c09e810e32f7c3224, added code to create
	a dummy tap device with guaranteed lowest MAC address and attach it to
	the bridge. This tap device was given the name "${bridgename}-nic".
	However, an interface device name must be IFNAMSIZ (15) characters or
	less, so a valid ${bridgename} such as "verylongname123" (15
	characters) would lead to an invalid tap device name
	("verylongname123-nic" - 19 characters), and that in turn led to a
	failure to bring up the network.

	The solution is to shorten the part of the original name used to
	generate the tap device name. However, simply truncating it is
	insufficient, because the last few characters of an interface name are
	often a number used to indicate one of a list of several similar
	devices (for example, "verylongname123", "verylongname124", etc) and
	simple truncation would lead to duplicate names (eg "verlongnam-nic"
	and "verylongnam-nic"). So instead we take the first 8 characters of
	$bridgename ("verylong" in the example), add on the final 3 bytes
	("123"), then add "-nic" (so "verylong123-nic").  Not pretty, but it
	is much more likely to generate a unique name, and is reproducible
	(unlike, say, a random number).

	PHYP: Adding network interface
	This is the implementation of the previous patch now using virInterface*
	API. Ended up this patch got much more simpler, smaller and easier to
	review. Here is some details:

	  * MAC size and interface name are fixed due to specifications on HMC,
	    both are created automatically and CAN'T be specified from user. They
	    have the following format:

	     * MAC: 122980003002
	     * Interface name: U9124.720.067BE8B-V3-C0

	  * I did replaced all the |grep|sed following the comments Eric Blake
	    did on the last patch.

	  * According to my last email, It's not possible to create a network
	    interface without assigning it to a specific lpar. Then, I am using
	    this very minimalistic XML file for testing:

	     <interface type='ethernet' name='LPAR01'>
	     </interface>

	    In this file I am using "name" as the lpar name which I am going to
	    assign the new network interface. I couldn't find a better way to
	    refer to it. Comments are welcome.

	  * Regarding the fact I am sleeping one second waiting for the HMC to
	    complete creation of the interface, I don't have means to check
	    if the whole process is done. All I do is execute a command, wait
	    until is complete (which is not enough in this case) check
	    the return and the exit status. The process of actually creating
	    a networking interface seems to take a little longer than just the
	    return of the ssh control.

	the function tries to call qemuDriverLock with virDomainObj locked,
	this causes the dead-lock problem. This patch fixes this.

	util: Fix crash when removing entries during hash iteration
	Commit 9677cd33eea4c65d78ba463b46b8b45ed2da1709 made it possible to
	remove current entry when iterating through all hash entries. However,
	it didn't properly handle a special case of removing first entry
	assigned to a given key which contains several entries in its collision

	setmaxmem: add the new options to "virsh setmaxmem" command
	This patch adds the new options (--live, --config, and --current) to
	"virsh setmaxmem" command. The behavior of above options is the same
	as that of "virsh setmem".  When the --config option is specified, a
	modification is effective for the persistent domain, while the --live

	qemu: Remove the managed state file only if restoring succeeded
	1) Both "qemuDomainStartWithFlags" and "qemuAutostartDomain" try to
	restore the domain from managedsave'ed image if it exists (by
	invoking "qemuDomainObjRestore"), but it unlinks the image even
	if restoring fails, which causes data loss. (This problem exists
	for "virsh managedsave dom; virsh start dom").

	The fix for is to unlink the managed state file only if restoring
	succeeded.

	2) For "virsh save dom; virsh restore dom;", it can cause data
	corruption if one reuse the saved state file for restoring. Add
	doc to tell user about it.

	3) In "qemuDomainObjStart", if "managed_save" is NULL, we shouldn't
	fallback to start the domain, skipping it to cleanup as a incidental
	fix. Discovered by Eric.

	We should bind pci device to original driver when pciBindDeviceToStub() failed.

	Change locking for udev monitor and callbacks
	We're seeing bugs apparently resulting from thread unsafety of
	libpciaccess, such as
	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/726099
	To prevent those, as suggested by danpb on irc, move the
	nodeDeviceLock(driverState) higher into the callers.  In
	particular:

	  udevDeviceMonitorStartup should hold the lock while calling
	  udevEnumerateDevices(), and udevEventHandleCallback should hold it
	  over its entire execution.

	It's not clear to me whether it is ok to hold the
	nodeDeviceLock while taking the virNodeDeviceObjLock(dev) on a
	device.  If not, then the lock will need to be dropped around
	the calling of udevSetupSystemDev(), and udevAddOneDevice()
	may not actually be safe to call from higher layers with the
	driverstate lock held.

	libvirt 0.8.8 with this patch on it seems to work fine for me.
	Assuming it looks ok and I haven't done anything obviously dumb,
	I'll ask the bug submitters to try this patch.

	build: detect potentential uninitialized variables
	Even with -Wuninitialized (which is part of autobuild.sh
	--enable-compile-warnings=error), gcc does NOT catch this
	use of an uninitialized variable:

	{
	  if (cond)
	    goto error;
	  int a = 1;
	error:
	  printf("%d", a);
	}

	which prints 0 (supposing the stack started life wiped) if
	cond was true.  Clang will catch it, but we don't use clang
	as often.  Using gcc -Wjump-misses-init catches it, but also
	gives false positives:

	{
	  if (cond)
	    goto error;
	  int a = 1;
	  return a;
	error:
	  return 0;
	}

	Here, a was never used in the scope of the error block, so
	declaring it after goto is technically fine (and clang agrees).
	However, given that our HACKING already documents a preference
	to C89 decl-before-statement, the false positive warning is
	enough of a prod to comply with HACKING.

	[Personally, I'd _really_ rather use C99 decl-after-statement
	to minimize scope, but until gcc can efficiently and reliably
	catch scoping and uninitialized usage bugs, I'll settle with
	the compromise of enforcing a coding standard that happens to
	reject false positives if it can also detect real bugs.]

	fix memory leak in qemuProcessHandleGraphics()
	If strdup("x509dname") or strdup("saslUsername") success, but
	strdup(x509dname) or strdup(saslUsername) failed, subject->nidentity
	is not the num elements of subject->identities, and we will leak some
	memory.

	do not lock vm while allocating memory
	There is no need to lock vm while allocating memory. If allocating
	memory failed, we forgot to unlock vm.

	Fix libxl driver startup
	  When you happen to have a libvirtd binary compiled with the
	libxenlight driver (say you have installed xen-4.1 libraries)
	but not running a xen enabled system, then libvirtd fails to start.

	The cause is that libxlStartup() returns -1 when failing to initialize
	the library, and this propagates to virStateInitialize() which consider
	this a failure. We should only exit libxlStartup with an error code
	if something like an allocation error occurs, not if the driver failed
	to initialize.

	* src/libxl/libxl_driver.c: fix libxlStartup() to not return -1
	  when failing to initialize the libxenlight library

	Commit 78ba748ef14c520ff1c4af2b5b0a44586ac49c8c claims to fix
	documentation for swap_hard_limit virsh memtune option but it only fixes

	qemu: Ignore libvirt debug messages in qemu log
	qemu driver uses a 4K buffer for reading qemu log file. This is enough
	when only qemu's output is present in the log file. However, when
	debugging messages are turned on, intermediate libvirt process fills the
	log with a bunch of debugging messages before it executes qemu binary.
	In such a case the buffer may become too small. However, we are not
	really interested in libvirt messages so they can be filtered out from
	the buffer.

	qemu: Fix improper logic of qemuCgroupSetup
	It throws errors as long as the cgroup controller is not available,
	regardless of whether we really want to use it to do setup or not,
	which is not what we want, fixing it with throwing error when need
	to use the controller.

	And change "VIR_WARN" to "qemuReportError" for memory controller
	incidentally.

2011-04-01  Wen Congyang  <wency@cn.fujitsu.com>

	free tmp after unlinking it
	We create a temporary file to save memory, and we will remove it after reading
	memory to buffer. But we free the variable that contains the temporary filename
	before we remove it. So we should free tmp after unlinking it.

	check whether qemuMonitorJSONHMP() failed
	If qemu quited unexpectedly when we call qemuMonitorJSONHMP(),
	libvirt will crash.
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	1. use gdb to attach libvirtd, and set a breakpoint in the function
	   qemuMonitorSetCapabilities()
	2. start a vm
	3. let the libvirtd to run until qemuMonitorJSONSetCapabilities() returns.
	4. kill the qemu process
	5. continue running libvirtd

	do not send monitor command after monitor meet error
	If the monitor met a error, and we will call qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF().
	But we may try to send monitor command after qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF()
	returned. Then libvirtd will be blocked in qemuMonitorSend().

	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	1. use gdb to attach libvirtd, and set a breakpoint in the function
	   qemuConnectMonitor()
	2. start a vm
	3. let the libvirtd to run until qemuMonitorOpen() returns.
	4. kill the qemu process
	5. continue running libvirtd

	extend logging to record configuration-related changes
	Currently libvirt's default logging is limited and it is difficult to
	determine what was happening when a proglem occurred (especially on a
	machines where one don't know the detail.)  This patch helps to do that
	by making additional logging available for the following events:

	  creating/defining/undefining domains
	  creating/defining/undefining/starting/stopping networks
	  creating/defining/undefining/starting/stopping storage pools
	  creating/defining/undefining/starting/stopping storage volumes.

	qemu: fix regression with fd labeling on migration
	My earlier testing for commit 34fa0de0 was done while starting
	just-built libvirt from an unconfined_t shell, where the fds happened
	to work when transferring to qemu.  But when installed and run under
	virtd_t, failure to label the raw file (with no compression) or the
	pipe (with compression) triggers SELinux failures when passing fds
	over SCM_RIGHTS to svirt_t qemu.

	* src/qemu/qemu_migration.c (qemuMigrationToFile): When passing
	FDs, make sure they are labeled.

2011-03-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	qemu: improve error message on failed fd transfer
	First fallout of fd: migration - it looks like SELinux enforcing
	_does_ require fd labeling (running uninstalled libvirtd from an
	unconstrained shell had no problems, but once faked out by doing
	 chcon `stat -c %C /usr/sbin/libvirtd` daemon/libvirtd
	 run_init $PWD/daemon/libvirtd
	to run it with the same context as an init script service, and with
	SELinux enforcing, I got a rather confusing failure:
	error: Failed to save domain fedora_12 to fed12.img
	error: internal error unable to send TAP file handle: No file descriptor supplied via SCM_RIGHTS

	This fixes the error message, then I need to figure out a subsequent
	patch that does the fsetfilecon() necessary to keep things happy.
	It also appears that libvirtd hangs on a failed fd transfer; I don't
	know if that needs an independent fix.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c (qemuMonitorTextSendFileHandle):
	Improve message, since TAP is no longer only client.

	Currently, the hook function in virFileOperation is extremely limited:

2011-03-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	qemu: allow simple domain save to use fd: protocol
	This allows direct saves (no compression, no root-squash NFS) to use
	the more efficient fd: migration, which in turn avoids a race where
	qemu exec: migration can sometimes fail because qemu does a generic
	waitpid() that conflicts with the pclose() used by exec:.  Further
	patches will solve compression and root-squash NFS.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainSaveFlag): Use new function
	when there is no compression.

2011-03-29  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	qemu: fix restoring a compressed save image
	Latent bug introduced in commit 2d6a581960 (Aug 2009), but not exposed
	until commit 1859939a (Jan 2011).  Basically, when virExec creates a
	pipe, it always marks libvirt's side as cloexec.  If libvirt then
	wants to hand that pipe to another child process, things work great if
	the fd is dup2()'d onto stdin or stdout (as with stdin: or exec:
	migration), but if the pipe is instead used as-is (such as with fd:
	migration) then qemu sees EBADF because the fd was closed at exec().

	This is a minimal fix for the problem at hand; it is slightly racy,
	but no more racy than the rest of libvirt fd handling, including the
	case of uncompressed save images.  A more invasive fix, but ultimately
	safer at avoiding leaking unintended fds, would be to _always and

	Remove the Open Nebula driver
	The Open Nebula driver has been unmaintained since it was first
	introduced. The only commits have been for tree-wide cleanups.
	It also has a major design flaw, in that it only knows about guests
	that it has created itself, which makes it of very limited use.

	Discussions wrt evolution of the VMWare ESX driver, concluded that
	it should limit itself to single-node ESX operation and not try to
	manage the multi-node architecture of VirtualCenter. Open Nebula
	is a cluster like Virtual Center, not a single node system, so
	the same reasoning applies.

	The DeltaCloud project includes an Open Nebula driver and is a much
	better fit architecturally, since it is explicitly targetting the
	distributed multihost cluster scenario.

	Thus this patch deletes the libvirt Open Nebula driver with the
	recommendation that people use DeltaCloud for managing it instead.

2011-03-28  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Update on the goal page
	Some things to note in this patch:
	   - we do extend libvirt scope beyond purely managing domains, there is
	     already a number of blocks which are here as helpr functions to
	     manage the resources on the host.
	   - we are expanding in the direction of libvirt being sufficient to do
	     most of the management on the Host (but within the limits of the need
	     for virtualization, e.g. managing users on the host is out of scope)
	   - we don't require anymore APIs to be supported by multiple
	     hypervisors to get in, it's already the case in practice, but we
	     should still make sure the semantic of those APIs are clear. We
	     added quite a bit for QEmu, but for example I saw on IRC that VBox
	     could emulate a network unplug/replug on a domain interface, and
	     that would be a good addition even if a priori no other hypervisor
	     supports it.
	   - Make clear that all libvirt APIs are available remotely, which is
	     key to use libvirt for building management tools.
	   - link the goal page from the project main page

	As for libvirt project directions, I think it just reflects the natural
	evolution in the last couple of years. We are less hypervisor agnostic
	and extending in the Host management. Clearly there is interest in
	making sure libvirt is complete in term of features for the hypervisors
	supported, especially the ones like KVM or LXC which don't really have
	integrated management library.

	Sometimes, an asynchronous helper is started (such as a compressor

	WIFEXITED(status) is true and WEXITSTATUS(status)==0 for all
	known platforms) or were filtering on WIFEXITED before printing
	a status, but a few were missing this check.  Additionally,

	Get cpu time and current memory balloon from libxl

2011-03-24  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Make error reporting in libvirtd thread safe
	Bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=689374 reported libvirtd
	crash during error dispatch.

	The reason is that libvirtd uses remoteDispatchConnError() with non-NULL
	conn parameter which means that virConnGetLastError() is used instead of
	its thread safe replacement virGetLastError().

	So when several libvirtd threads are reporting errors at the same time,
	the errors can get mixed or corrupted or in case of bad luck libvirtd
	itself crashes.

	Since Daniel B. is going to rewrite this code from scratch on top of his
	RPC infrastructure, I tried to come up with a minimal fix. Thus,
	remoteDispatchConnError() now just ignores its conn argument and always
	calls virGetLastError(). However, several callers had to be touched as
	well, since no libvirt API is allowed to be called before dispatching
	the error. Doing so would reset the error and we would have nothing to
	dispatch. As a result of that, the code is not very nice but that
	doesn't really make daemon/remote.c worse than it is now :-) And it will
	all die soon, which is good.

	The bug report also contains a reproducer in C which detects both mixed
	up error messages and libvirtd crash. Before this patch, I was able to
	crash libvirtd in about 20 seconds up to 3 minutes depending on number
	of CPU cores (more is better) and luck.

	   error: Failed to attach disk
	   error: operation failed: adding scsi-disk,bus=scsi0.0,scsi-id=1,drive=drive-scsi0-0-1,id=scsi0-0-1 device failed: Property 'scsi-disk.drive' can't find value 'drive-scsi0-0-1'
	2. service libvirtd restart
	   Stopping libvirtd daemon:                                  [  OK  ]
	   Starting libvirtd daemon:                                  [  OK  ]
	3. virsh attach-disk domain --source diskimage --target sdb --sourcetype file --driver qemu --subdriver raw
	   error: Failed to attach disk
	   error: operation failed: adding lsi,id=scsi0,bus=pci.0,addr=0x6 device failed: Duplicate ID 'scsi0' for device

	The reason is that we create a new scsi controller but we do not update
	/var/run/libvirt/qemu/domain.xml.

	util: Fix return value for virJSONValueFromString if it fails
	Problem:
	  "parser.head" is not NULL even if it's free'ed by "virJSONValueFree",
	returning "parser.head" when "virJSONValueFromString" fails will cause
	unexpected errors (libvirtd will crash sometimes), e.g.
	  In function "qemuMonitorJSONArbitraryCommand":

	        if (!(cmd = virJSONValueFromString(cmd_str)))
	            goto cleanup;

	        if (qemuMonitorJSONCommand(mon, cmd, &reply) < 0)
	            goto cleanup;

	        ......

	     cleanup:
	        virJSONValueFree(cmd);

	  It will continues to send command to monitor even if "virJSONValueFromString"
	is failed, and more worse, it trys to free "cmd" again.

	  Crash example:
	{"error":{"class":"QMPBadInputObject","desc":"Expected 'execute' in QMP input","data":{"expected":"execute"}}}
	{"error":{"class":"QMPBadInputObject","desc":"Expected 'execute' in QMP input","data":{"expected":"execute"}}}
	error: server closed connection:
	error: unable to connect to '/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock', libvirtd may need to be started: Connection refused
	error: failed to connect to the hypervisor

	  This fix is to:
	    1) return NULL for failure of "virJSONValueFromString",
	    2) and it seems "virJSONValueFree" uses incorrect loop index for type
	       of "VIR_JSON_TYPE_OBJECT", fix it together.

	qemu: simplify interface fd handling in monitor
	With only a single caller to these two monitor commands, I
	didn't need to wrap a new WithFds version, but just change
	the command itself.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h (qemuMonitorAddNetdev)
	(qemuMonitorAddHostNetwork): Add parameters.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c (qemuMonitorAddNetdev)
	(qemuMonitorAddHostNetwork): Add support for fd passing.
	* src/qemu/qemu_hotplug.c (qemuDomainAttachNetDevice): Use it to
	simplify code.

2011-03-22  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	qemu: simplify PCI configfd handling in monitor
	This is also a bug fix - on the error path, qemu_hotplug would
	leave the configfd file leaked into qemu.  At least the next
	attempt to hotplug a PCI device would reuse the same fdname,
	and when the qemu getfd monitor command gets a new fd by the
	same name as an earlier one, it closes the earlier one, so there
	is no risk of qemu running out of fds.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h (qemuMonitorAddDeviceWithFd): New
	prototype.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c (qemuMonitorAddDevice): Move guts...
	(qemuMonitorAddDeviceWithFd): ...to new function, and add support
	for fd passing.
	* src/qemu/qemu_hotplug.c (qemuDomainAttachHostPciDevice): Use it
	to simplify code.
	Suggested by Daniel P. Berrange.

	qemu: simplify monitor fd error handling
	qemu_monitor was already returning -1 and setting errno to EINVAL
	on any attempt to send an fd without a unix socket, but this was
	a silent failure in the case of qemuDomainAttachHostPciDevice.
	Meanwhile, qemuDomainAttachNetDevice was doing some sanity checking
	for a better error message; it's better to consolidate that to a
	central point in the API.

	* src/qemu/qemu_hotplug.c (qemuDomainAttachNetDevice): Move sanity
	checking...
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c (qemuMonitorSendFileHandle): ...into
	central location.
	Suggested by Chris Wright.

	network driver: log error and abort network startup when radvd isn't found
	This is detailed in:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=688957

	Since radvd is executed by daemonizing it, the attempt to exec the
	radvd binary doesn't happen until after libvirtd has already received
	an exit code from the intermediate forked process, so no error is
	detected or logged by __virExec().

	We can't require radvd as a prerequisite for the libvirt package (many
	installations don't use IPv6, so they don't need it), so instead we
	add in a check to verify there is an executable radvd binary prior to
	trying to exec it.

	Fix delayed event delivery when SASL is active
	When SASL is active, it was possible that we read and decoded
	more data off the wire than we initially wanted. The loop
	processing this data terminated after only one message to
	avoid delaying the calling thread, but this could delay
	event delivery. As long as there is decoded SASL data in
	memory, we must process it, before returning to the poll()
	event loop.

	This is a counterpart to the same kind of issue solved in

	  commit 68d2c3482fa16801f8e6ca5c42698319bb87f385

	Add libxenlight driver
	Add a new xen driver based on libxenlight [1], which is the primary
	toolstack starting with Xen 4.1.0.  The driver is stateful and runs
	privileged only.

	Like the existing xen-unified driver, the libxenlight driver is
	accessed with xen:// URI.  Driver selection is based on the status
	of xend.  If xend is running, the libxenlight driver will not load
	and xen:// connections are handled by xen-unified.  If xend is not
	running *and* the libxenlight driver is available, xen://
	connections are deferred to the libxenlight driver.

	V6:
	 - Address several code style issues noted by Daniel Veillard
	 - Make drive work with xen:/// URI
	 - Hold domain object reference while domain is injected in
	   libvirt event loop.  Race found and fixed by Markus Groß.

	V5:
	 - Ensure events are unregistered when domain private data
	   is destroyed.  Discovered and fixed by Markus Groß.

	V4:
	 - Handle restart of libvirtd, reconnecting to previously
	   started domains
	 - Rebased to current master
	 - Tested against Xen 4.1 RC7-pre (c/s 22961:c5d121fd35c0)

	V3:
	  - Reserve vnc port within driver when autoport=yes

	V2:
	  - Update to Xen 4.1 RC6-pre (c/s 22940:5a4710640f81)
	  - Rebased to current master
	  - Plug memory leaks found by Stefano Stabellini and valgrind
	  - Handle SHUTDOWN_crash domain death event

	qemu: Fix copy&paste error messages in text monitor

2011-03-18  Wen Congyang  <wency@cn.fujitsu.com>

	do not unref obj in qemuDomainObjExitMonitor*
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	# cat test.sh
	  #! /bin/bash -x
	  virsh start domain
	  sleep 5
	  virsh qemu-monitor-command domain 'cpu_set 2 online' --hmp
	# while true; do ./test.sh ; done

	Then libvirtd will crash.

	The reason is that:
	we add a reference of obj when we open the monitor. We will reduce this
	reference when we free the monitor.

	If the reference of monitor is 0, we will free monitor automatically and
	the reference of obj is reduced.

	But in the function qemuDomainObjExitMonitorWithDriver(), we reduce this
	reference again when the reference of monitor is 0.

	It will cause the obj be freed in the function qemuDomainObjEndJob().

	Then we start the domain again, and libvirtd will crash in the function
	virDomainObjListSearchName(), because we pass a null pointer(obj->def->name)
	to strcmp().

	qemu: check driver name while attaching disk
	This bug was reported by Shi Jin(jinzishuai@gmail.com):

	# virsh attach-disk RHEL6RC /var/lib/libvirt/images/test3.img vdb \
	        --driver file --subdriver qcow2
	Disk attached successfully

	# virsh save RHEL6RC /var/lib/libvirt/images/memory.save
	Domain RHEL6RC saved to /var/lib/libvirt/images/memory.save

	# virsh restore /var/lib/libvirt/images/memory.save

	error: internal error unsupported driver name 'file'
	       for disk '/var/lib/libvirt/images/test3.img'

	We check the driver name when we start or restore VM, but we do
	not check it while attaching a disk. This adds the same check on disk

	Improve logging documentation including the debug buffer

2011-03-18  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Avoid taking lock in libvirt debug dump
	As pointed out, locking the buffer from the signal handler
	cannot been guaranteed to be safe, so to avoid any hazard
	we prefer the trade off of dumping logs possibly messed up
	by concurrent logging activity rather than risk a daemon
	crash.

	* src/util/logging.c: change virLogEmergencyDumpAll() to not
	  take any lock on the log buffer but reset buffer content variables
	  to an empty set before starting the actual dump.

	unlock the monitor when unwatching the monitor
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	# virsh qemu-monitor-command domain 'cpu_set 2 online' --hmp
	The domain has 2 cpus, and we try to set the third cpu online.
	The qemu crashes, and this command will hang.

	The reason is that the refs is not 1 when we unwatch the monitor.
	We lock the monitor, but we do not unlock it. So virCondWait()
	will be blocked.

	macvtap: log an error if on failure to connect to netlink socket
	A bug in libnl (see https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677724
	and https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=677725) makes it very
	easy to create a failure to connect to the netlink socket when trying
	to open a macvtap network device ("type='direct'" in domain interface
	XML). When that error occurred (during a call to libnl's nl_connect()
	from libvirt's nlComm(), there was no log message, leading virsh (for
	example) to report "unknown error".

	There were two other cases in nlComm where an error in a libnl
	function might return with failure but no error reported. In all three
	cases, this patch logs a message which will hopefully be more useful.

	Note that more detailed information about the failure might be
	available from libnl's nl_geterror() function, but it calls
	strerror(), which is not threadsafe, so we can't use it.

	qemu: improve efficiency of dd during snapshots
	POSIX states about dd:

	If the bs=expr operand is specified and no conversions other than
	sync, noerror, or notrunc are requested, the data returned from each
	input block shall be written as a separate output block; if the read
	returns less than a full block and the sync conversion is not
	specified, the resulting output block shall be the same size as the
	input block. If the bs=expr operand is not specified, or a conversion
	other than sync, noerror, or notrunc is requested, the input shall be
	processed and collected into full-sized output blocks until the end of
	the input is reached.

	Since we aren't using conv=sync, there is no zero-padding, but our
	use of bs= means that a short read results in a short write.  If
	instead we use ibs= and obs=, then short reads are collected and dd
	only has to do a single write, which can make dd more efficient.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c (qemuMonitorMigrateToFile):
	Avoid 'dd bs=', since it can cause short writes.

	Fix misc bugs in virCommandPtr
	The virCommandNewArgs() method would free the virCommandPtr
	if it failed to add the args. This meant errors reported in

	The virCommandAddEnvPassCommon() method failed to check for
	errors before reallocating the cmd->env array, causing a

	Make LXC container startup/shutdown/I/O more robust
	The current LXC I/O controller looks for HUP to detect
	when a guest has quit. This isn't reliable as during
	initial bootup it is possible that 'init' will close
	the console and let mingetty re-open it. The shutdown
	of containers was also flakey because it only killed
	the libvirt I/O controller and expected container
	processes to gracefully follow.

	Change the I/O controller such that when it see HUP
	or an I/O error, it uses kill($PID, 0) to see if the
	process has really quit.

	Change the container shutdown sequence to use the

	audit: eliminate potential null pointer deref when auditing macvtap devices
	The newly added call to qemuAuditNetDevice in qemuPhysIfaceConnect was
	assuming that res_ifname (the name of the macvtap device) was always
	valid, but this isn't the case. If openMacvtapTap fails, it always
	returns NULL, which would result in a segv.

	Since the audit log only needs a record of devices that are actually
	sent to qemu, and a failure to open the macvtap device means that no
	device will be sent to qemu, we can solve this problem by only doing
	the audit if openMacvtapTap is successful (in which case res_ifname is
	guaranteed valid).

	network driver: don't send default route to clients on isolated networks
	Normally dnsmasq will send a default route (the address of the host in
	the network definition) to any client requesting an address via
	DHCP. On an isolated network this makes no sense, as we have iptables
	to prevent any traffic going out via that interface, so anything sent
	that way would be dropped anyway.

	This extra/unusable default route becomes problematic if you have
	setup a guest with multiple network interfaces, with one connected to
	an isolated network and another that provides connectivity to the
	outside (example - one interface directly connecting to a physical
	interface via macvtap, with a second connected to an isolated network
	so that the host and guest can communicate (macvtap doesn't support
	guest<->host communication without an external switch that supports
	vepa, or reflecting all traffic back)). In this case, if the guest
	chooses the default route of the isolated network, the guest will not
	be able to get network traffic beyond the host.

	To prevent dnsmasq from sending a default route, you can tell it to
	send 0 bytes of data for the default route option (option number 3)
	with --dhcp-option=3 (normally the data to send for the option would
	follow the option number; no extra data means "don't send this option").

	I have checked on RHEL5 (a good representative of the oldest supported
	libvirt platforms) and its version of dnsmasq (2.45) does support
	--dhcp-option, so this shouldn't create any compatibility problems.

	python: Use hardcoded python path in libvirt.py
	This partially reverts (and fixes that part in a different way) commit
	e4384459c93e3e786aa483c7f077d1d22148f689, which replaced
	``/usr/bin/python'' with ``/usr/bin/env python'' in all examples or
	scripts used during build to generate other files.

	However, python bindings module is compiled and linked against a
	specific python discovered or explicitly provided in configure phase.
	Thus libvirt.py, which is generated and installed into the system,
	should use the same python binary for which the module has been built.

	The hunk in Makefile.am replaces $(srcdir) with $(PYTHON), which might
	seem wrong but it is not. generator.py didn't use any of its command
	line arguments so passing $(srcdir) to it was redundant.

	network driver: Use a separate dhcp leases file for each network
	By default, all dnsmasq processes share the same leases file. libvirt
	also uses the --dhcp-lease-max option to control the maximum number of
	leases allowed. The problem is that libvirt puts in a number equal to
	the number of addresses in the range for the one network handled by a
	single instance of dnsmasq, but dnsmasq checks the total number of
	leases in the file (which could potentially contain many more).

	The solution is to tell each instance of dnsmasq to create and use its
	own leases file. (/var/lib/libvirt/network/<net-name>.leases).

	This file is created by dnsmasq when it starts, but not deleted when
	it exists. This is fine when the network is just being stopped, but if
	the leases file was left around when a network was undefined, we could
	end up with an ever-increasing number of dead files - instead, we
	explicitly unlink the leases file when a network is undefined.

	Note that Ubuntu carries a patch against an older version of libvirt for this:

	hhttps://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/libvirt/+bug/713071
	ttp://bazaar.launchpad.net/~serge-hallyn/ubuntu/maverick/libvirt/bugall/revision/109

	I was certain I'd also seen discussion of this on libvir-list or
	libvirt-users, but couldn't find it.

	network driver: Fix indentation from previous commit
	The previous commit put a large portion of networkBuildDnsmasqArgv
	inside an if { } block. This readjusts the indentation.

2011-03-12  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	network driver: Start dnsmasq even if no dhcp ranges/hosts are specified.
	This fixes a regression introduced in commit ad48df, and reported on
	the libvirt-users list:

	  https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2011-March/msg00018.html

	The problem in that commit was that we began searching a list of ip
	address definitions (rather than just having one) to look for a dhcp
	range or static host; when we didn't find any, our pointer (ipdef) was
	left at NULL, and when ipdef was NULL, we returned without starting up
	dnsmasq.

	Previously dnsmasq was started even without any dhcp ranges or static
	entries, because it's still useful for DNS services.

	Another problem I noticed while investigating was that, if there are
	IPv6 addresses, but no IPv4 addresses of any kind, we would jump out
	at an ever higher level in the call chain.

	This patch does the following:

	1) networkBuildDnsmasqArgv() = all uses of ipdef are protected from
	   NULL dereference. (this patch doesn't change indentation, to make
	   review easier. The next patch will change just the
	   indentation). ipdef is intended to point to the first IPv4 address
	   with DHCP info (or the first IPv4 address if none of them have any
	   dhcp info).

	2) networkStartDhcpDaemon() = if the loop looking for an ipdef with
	   DHCP info comes up empty, we then grab the first IPv4 def from the
	   list. Also, instead of returning if there are no IPv4 defs, we just
	   return if there are no IP defs at all (either v4 or v6). This way a
	   network that is IPv6-only will still get dnsmasq listening for DNS
	   queries.

	3) in networkStartNetworkDaemon() - we will startup dhcp not just if there
	   are any IPv4 addresses, but also if there are any IPv6 addresses.

	domain.rng vs. formatdomain.html#elementsUSB
	The Relax-NG schema for domains regarding <hostdev> doesn't match what's
	implemented in src/conf/domain_conf.c#virDomainHostdevDefFormat(): The
	implementation only requires @type, but the schema currently either
	required none or all three attributes (@mode, @type, and @managed) to be
	defined together, because they are declared in the same
	<optional)-section. (@managed is currently even undocumented on
	<http://libvirt.org/formatdomain.html#elementsUSB>).

	Thus the following minimal <hostdev>-example fails to validate:
	<domain type='test'>
	        <name>N</name>
	        <memory>4096</memory>
	        <bootloader>/bin/false</bootloader>
	        <os>
	                <type arch='x86_64' machine='xenpv'>linux</type>
	        </os>
	        <devices>
	                <hostdev type='pci'>
	                        <source>
	                                <address bus='0x06' slot='0x00' function='0x0'/>
	                        </source>
	                </hostdev>
	        </devices>
	</domain>

	The schema is changed to match the current implementation:
	1. @mode is optional (which defaults to 'subsystem')
	2. @type is required
	3. @managed is optional (which defaults to 'no')

	The documentation is updated to mention @managed.

	Ignore backing file errors in FS storage pool
	Currently a single storage volume with a broken backing file will disable the
	whole storage pool. This can happen when the backing file is on some
	unavailable network storage or if the backing volume is deleted, while the
	storage volumes using it remain.
	Since the storage pool can not be re-activated, re-creating the missing
	or deleting the now useless volumes using libvirt only is not possible.

	Fixing this is a little bit tricky:
	1. virStorageBackendProbeTarget() only detects the missing backing file,
	   if the backing file format is not explicitly specified. If the
	   backing file is created using
		   kvm-img create -f qcow2 -o backing_fmt=qcow2,backing_file=... ...
	   no error is detected at this stage.
	   The new return code -3 signals that the backing file could not be
	   opened.
	2. The backingStore.format must be >= 0, since values < 0 would break
	   virStorageVolTargetDefFormat() when dumping the XML data such as
	       <format type='...'/>
	   Because of this the format is faked as VIR_STORAGE_FILE_RAW.
	3. virStorageBackendUpdateVolTargetInfo() always opens the backing file
	   and thus always detects a missing backing file.
	   Since it "only" updates the capacity, allocation, owner, group, mode
	   and SELinux label, just ignore errors at this stage, print an error
	   message and continue.
	4. Using vol-dump on a broken volume still doesn't work, but at least
	   vol-destroy and pool-refresh do work now.

	To reproduce:
	  dir=$(mktemp -d)
	  virsh pool-create-as tmp dir '' '' '' '' "$dir"
	  virsh vol-create-as --format qcow2 tmp back 1G
	  virsh vol-create-as --format qcow2 --backing-vol-format qcow2 --backing-vol back tmp cow 1G
	  virsh vol-delete --pool tmp back
	  virsh pool-refresh tmp
	After the last step, the pool will be gone (because it was not persistent). As
	long as the now broken image stays in the directory, you will not be able to
	re-create or re-start the pool.

	audit: audit use of /dev/net/tun, /dev/tapN, /dev/vhost-net
	Opening raw network devices with the intent of passing those fds to
	qemu is worth an audit point.  This makes a multi-part audit: first,
	we audit the device(s) that libvirt opens on behalf of the MAC address
	of a to-be-created interface (which can independently succeed or
	fail), then we audit whether qemu actually started the network device
	with the same MAC (so searching backwards for successful audits with
	the same MAC will show which fd(s) qemu is actually using).  Note that
	it is possible for the fd to be successfully opened but no attempt
	made to pass the fd to qemu (for example, because intermediate
	nwfilter operations failed) - no interface start audit will occur in
	that case; so the audit for a successful opened fd does not imply
	rights given to qemu unless there is a followup audit about the
	attempt to start a new interface.

	Likewise, when a network device is hot-unplugged, there is only one
	audit message about the MAC being discontinued; again, searching back
	to the earlier device open audits will show which fds that qemu quits
	using (and yes, I checked via /proc/<qemu-pid>/fd that qemu _does_
	close out the fds associated with an interface on hot-unplug).  The
	code would require much more refactoring to be able to definitively
	state which device(s) were discontinued at that point, since we
	currently don't record anywhere in the XML whether /dev/vhost-net was
	opened for a given interface.

	qemu: Support vram for video of qxl type
	For qemu names the primary vga as "qxl-vga":

	  1) if vram is specified for 2nd qxl device:

	    -vga qxl -global qxl-vga.vram_size=$SIZE \
	    -device qxl,id=video1,vram_size=$SIZE,...

	  2) if vram is not specified for 2nd qxl device, (use the default
	     set by global):

	    -vga qxl -global qxl-vga.vram_size=$SIZE \
	    -device qxl,id=video1,...

	For qemu names all qxl devices as "qxl":

	  1) if vram is specified for 2nd qxl device:

	    -vga qxl -global qxl.vram_size=$SIZE \
	    -device qxl,id=video1,vram_size=$SIZE ...

	  2) if vram is not specified for 2nd qxl device:

	    -vga qxl -global qxl-vga.vram_size=$SIZE \
	    -device qxl,id=video1,...

	"-global" is the only way to define vram_size for the primary qxl
	device, regardless of how qemu names it, (It's not good a good
	way, as original idea of "-global" is to set a global default for
	a driver property, but to specify vram for first qxl device, we
	have to use it).

	For other qxl devices, as they are represented by "-device", could
	specify it directly and seperately for each, and it overrides the
	default set by "-global" if specified.

	v1 - v2:
	  * modify "virDomainVideoDefaultRAM" so that it returns 16M as the
	    default vram_size for qxl device.

	  * vram_size * 1024 (qemu accepts bytes for vram_size).

	  * apply default vram_size for qxl device for which vram_size is
	    not specified.

	  * modify "graphics-spice" tests (more sensiable vram_size)

	  * Add an argument of virDomainDefPtr type for qemuBuildVideoDevStr,
	    to use virDomainVideoDefaultRAM in qemuBuildVideoDevStr).

	v2 - v3:
	  * Modify default video memory size for qxl device from 16M to 24M

	  * Update codes to be consistent with changes on qemu_capabilities.*

	logs, change it to a default file output libvirtd.log, but
	still keep standard error if not run as a daemon.
	Depending on whether it's run as root or user, the log is saved
	in the local state dir or in $HOME/.libvirt.
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: change default logging to go to libvirtd.log

	Force all logs to go to the round robbin memory buffer
	Initially only the log actually written out by libvirt were

	qemu: avoid corruption of domain hashtable and misuse of freed domains
	This was also found while investigating

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=670848

	An EOF on a domain's monitor socket results in an event being queued
	to handle the EOF. The handler calls qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF. If
	it is a transient domain, this leads to a call to
	virDomainRemoveInactive, which removes the domain from the driver's
	hashtable and unref's it. Nowhere in this code is the qemu driver lock
	acquired.

	However, all modifications to the driver's domain hashtable *must* be
	done while holding the driver lock, otherwise the hashtable can become
	corrupt, and (even more likely) another thread could call a different
	hashtable function and acquire a pointer to the domain that is in the
	process of being destroyed.

	To prevent such a disaster, qemuProcessHandleMonitorEOF must get the
	qemu driver lock *before* it gets the DomainObj's lock, and hold it
	until it is finished with the DomainObj. This guarantees that nobody
	else modifies the hashtable at the same time, and that anyone who had
	already gotten the DomainObj from the hashtable prior to this call has
	finished with it before we remove/destroy it.

2011-03-04  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	qemu: Add missing lock of virDomainObj before calling virDomainUnref
	This was found while researching the root cause of:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=670848

	virDomainUnref should only be called with the lock held for the
	virDomainObj in question. However, when a transient qemu domain gets
	EOF on its monitor socket, it queues an event which frees the monitor,
	which unref's the virDomainObj without first locking it. If another
	thread has already locked the virDomainObj, the modification of the
	refcount could potentially be corrupted. In an extreme case, it could
	also be potentially unlocked by virDomainObjFree, thus left open to
	modification by anyone else who would have otherwise waited for the
	lock (not to mention the fact that they would be accessing freed
	data!).

	The solution is to have qemuMonitorFree lock the domain object right
	before unrefing it. Since the caller to qemuMonitorFree doesn't expect
	this lock to be held, if the refcount doesn't go all the way to 0,
	qemuMonitorFree must unlock it after the unref.

	util: Allow removing hash entries in virHashForEach
	This fixes a possible crash of libvirtd during its startup. When qemu
	driver reconnects to running domains, it iterates over all domain
	objects in a hash. When reconnecting to an associated qemu monitor
	fails and the domain is transient, it's immediately removed from the
	hash. Despite the fact that it's explicitly forbidden to do so. If
	libvirtd is lucky enough, virHashForEach will access random memory when
	the callback finishes and the deamon will crash.

	Since it's trivial to fix virHashForEach to allow removal of hash
	entries while iterating through them, I went this way instead of fixing
	qemuReconnectDomain callback (and possibly others) to avoid deleting the
	entries.

	build: Fix API docs generation in VPATH build
	XSLT allows for two ways of generating the output of transformation.
	Either implicit, which xsltproc prints to stdout and can be redirected
	to a file using -o file. Or explicit, which means the stylesheet
	contains <xsl:document> element which specifies where the output should
	be saved. This can be used for generating more files by a single run of
	xsltproc and -o directory/ can change the directory where the output
	files will be stored.

	devhelp.xsl is special in that it combines both options in one
	stylesheet, which doesn't work well with -o:

	xsltproc --nonet -o ./devhelp/ ./devhelp/devhelp.xsl ./libvirt-api.xml

	Outputs 4 *.html files into ./devhelp but then tries to write to
	./devhelp/ as a file (hence the I/O error) rather than writing output to
	the fifth file devhelp/libvirt.devhelp.

	This patch modifies devhelp.xsl so that all files are generated using
	<xsl:document> element and -o directory/ can be used to override output
	directory where those files are saved.

2011-02-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove all object hashtable caches from virConnectPtr
	The virConnectPtr struct will cache instances of all other
	objects. APIs like virDomainLookupByUUID will return a
	cached object, so if you do virDomainLookupByUUID twice in
	a row, you'll get the same exact virDomainPtr instance.

	This does not have any performance benefit, since the actual
	logic in virDomainLookupByUUID (and other APIs returning
	virDomainPtr, etc instances) is not short-circuited. All
	it does is to ensure there is only one single virDomainPtr
	in existance for any given UUID.

	The caching has a number of downsides though, all relating
	to stale data. If APIs aren't careful to always overwrite
	the 'id' field in virDomainPtr it may become out of data.
	Likewise for the name field, if a guest is renamed, or if
	a guest is deleted, and then a new one created with the
	same UUID but different name.

	This has been an ongoing, endless source of bugs for all
	applications using libvirt from languages with garbage
	collection, causing them to get virDomainPtr instances
	from long ago with stale data.

	The caching is also a waste of memory resources, since
	both applications, and language bindings often maintain
	their own hashtable caches of object instances.

	This patch removes all the hash table caching, so all
	APIs return brand new virDomainPtr (etc) object instances.

	* src/datatypes.h: Delete all hash tables.
	* src/datatypes.c: Remove all object caching code

	remove duplicated call to reportOOMError

	remove space between function name and (
	There were several occurrences of an extra space inserted between
	a function name and the ( opening the argument list in
	datatypes.c. This is not consistent with the coding style used in
	the rest of this file so removing this extra space makes the
	code slightly more readable.

	don't check for NULL before calling virHashFree
	virHashFree follows the convention described in HACKING that
	XXXFree() functions can be called with a NULL argument.

	remove no longer needed calls to virReportOOMError
	Now that the virHash handling functions call virReportOOMError by
	themselves when needed, users of the virHash API no longer need to
	do it by themselves. Since users of the virHash API were not
	consistently calling virReportOOMError after memory failures from
	the virHash code, this has the added benefit of making OOM
	reporting from this code more consistent and reliable.

	factor common code in virHashAddEntry and virHashUpdateEntry
	The only difference between these 2 functions is that one errors
	out when the entry is already present while the other modifies
	the existing entry. Add an helper function with a boolean argument
	indicating whether existing entries should be updated or not, and
	use this helper in both functions.

	add hash table rebalancing in virHashUpdateEntry
	The code in virHashUpdateEntry and virHashAddEntry is really
	similar. However, the latter rebalances the hash table when
	one of its buckets contains too many elements while the former
	does not. Fix this discrepancy.

	Give each virtual network bridge its own fixed MAC address
	This fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=609463

	The problem was that, since a bridge always acquires the MAC address
	of the connected interface with the numerically lowest MAC, as guests
	are started and stopped, it was possible for the MAC address to change
	over time, and this change in the network was being detected by
	Windows 7 (it sees the MAC of the default route change), so on each
	reboot it would bring up a dialog box asking about this "new network".

	The solution is to create a dummy tap interface with a MAC guaranteed
	to be lower than any guest interface's MAC, and attach that tap to the
	bridge as soon as it's created. Since all guest MAC addresses start
	with 0xFE, we can just generate a MAC with the standard "0x52, 0x54,
	0" prefix, and it's guaranteed to always win (physical interfaces are
	never connected to these bridges, so we don't need to worry about
	competing numerically with them).

	Note that the dummy tap is never set to IFF_UP state - that's not
	necessary in order for the bridge to take its MAC, and not setting it
	to UP eliminates the clutter of having an (eg) "virbr0-nic" displayed
	in the output of the ifconfig command.

	I chose to not auto-generate the MAC address in the network XML
	parser, as there are likely to be consumers of that API that don't
	need or want to have a MAC address associated with the
	bridge.

	Instead, in bridge_driver.c when the network is being defined, if
	there is no MAC, one is generated. To account for virtual network
	configs that already exist when upgrading from an older version of
	libvirt, I've added a %post script to the specfile that searches for
	all network definitions in both the config directory
	(/etc/libvirt/qemu/networks) and the state directory
	(/var/lib/libvirt/network) that are missing a mac address, generates a
	random address, and adds it to the config (and a matching address to
	the state file, if there is one).

	Allow brAddTap to create a tap device that is down
	An upcoming patch has a use for a tap device to be created that
	doesn't need to be actually put into the "up" state, and keeping it

	(ifconfig won't show down interfaces unless you add "-a").

	Add txmode attribute to interface XML for virtio backend
	This is in response to:

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=629662

	Explanation

	qemu's virtio-net-pci driver allows setting the algorithm used for tx
	packets to either "bh" or "timer". This is done by adding ",tx=bh" or
	",tx=timer" to the "-device virtio-net-pci" commandline option.

	'bh' stands for 'bottom half'; when this is set, packet tx is all done
	in an iothread in the bottom half of the driver. (In libvirt, this
	option is called the more descriptive "iothread".)

	'timer' means that tx work is done in qemu, and if there is more tx
	data than can be sent at the present time, a timer is set before qemu
	moves on to do other things; when the timer fires, another attempt is
	made to send more data. (libvirt retains the name "timer" for this
	option.)

	The resulting difference, according to the qemu developer who added
	the option is:

	    bh makes tx more asynchronous and reduces latency, but potentially
	    causes more processor bandwidth contention since the cpu doing the
	    tx isn't necessarily the cpu where the guest generated the
	    packets.

	Solution

	This patch provides a libvirt domain xml knob to change the option on
	the qemu commandline, by adding a new attribute "txmode" to the
	<driver> element that can be placed inside any <interface> element in
	a domain definition. It's use would be something like this:

	    <interface ...>
	      ...
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <driver txmode='iothread'/>
	      ...
	    </interface>

	I chose to put this setting as an attribute to <driver> rather than as
	a sub-element to <tune> because it is specific to the virtio-net
	driver, not something that is generally usable by all network drivers.
	(note that this is the same placement as the "driver name=..."
	attribute used to choose kernel vs. userland backend for the
	virtio-net driver.)

	Actually adding the tx=xxx option to the qemu commandline is only done
	if the version of qemu being used advertises it in the output of

	    qemu -device virtio-net-pci,?

	If a particular txmode is requested in the XML, and the option isn't
	listed in that help output, an UNSUPPORTED_CONFIG error is logged, and
	the domain fails to start.

2011-02-18  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Restructure domain struct interface "driver" data for easier expansion
	When the <driver> element (and its "name" attribute) was added to the
	domain XML's interface element, a "backend" enum was simply added to
	the toplevel of the virDomainNetDef struct.

	Ignoring the naming inconsistency ("name" vs. "backend"), this is fine
	when there's only a single item contained in the driver element of the
	XML, but doesn't scale well as we add more attributes that apply to
	the backend of the virtio-net driver, or add attributes applicable to
	other drivers.

	This patch changes virDomainNetDef in two ways:

	1) Rename the item in the struct from "backend" to "name", so that
	   it's the same in the XML and in the struct, hopefully avoiding
	   confusion for someone unfamiliar with the function of the
	   attribute.

	2) Create a "driver" union within virDomainNetDef, and a "virtio"
	   struct in that struct, which contains the "name" enum value.

	3) Move around the virDomainNetParse and virDomainNetFormat functions
	   to allow for simple plugin of new attributes without disturbing
	   existing code. (you'll note that this results in a seemingly
	   redundant if() in the format function, but that will no longer be
	   the case as soon as a 2nd attribute is added).

	In the future, new attributes for the virtio driver backend can be
	added to the "virtio" struct, and any other network device backend that
	needs an attribute will have its own struct added to the "driver"
	union.

	quotes.

	Using double quotes or escaping special shell characters with backslashes
	would also be possible, but the set of special characters heavily
	depends on the concrete shell (dsh, bash, zsh) and its setting (history
	expansion, interactive use, ...)

	Imprint all logs with version + package build information
	The logging functions are enhanced so that immediately prior to
	the first log message being printed to any output channel, the
	libvirt package version will be printed.

	eg

	 $ LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1 virsh
	 18:13:28.013: 17536: info : libvirt version: 0.8.7
	 18:13:28.013: 17536: debug : virInitialize:361 : register drivers
	 ...

	The 'configure' script gains two new arguments which can be
	used as

	   --with-packager="Fedora Project, x86-01.phx2.fedoraproject.org, 01-27-2011-18:00:10"
	   --with-packager-version="1.fc14"

	to allow distros to append a custom string with package specific
	data.

	The RPM specfile is modified so that it appends the RPM version,
	the build host, the build date and the packager name.

	eg

	 $ LIBVIRT_DEBUG=1 virsh
	 18:14:52.086: 17551: info : libvirt version: 0.8.7, package: 1.fc13 (Fedora Project, x86-01.phx2.fedoraproject.org, 01-27-2011-18:00:10)
	 18:14:52.086: 17551: debug : virInitialize:361 : register drivers

	Thus when distro packagers receive bug reports they can clearly
	see what version was in use, even if the bug reporter mistakenly
	or intentionally lies about version/builds

	* src/util/logging.c: Output version data prior to first log message
	* libvirt.spec.in: Include RPM release, date, hostname & packager
	* configure.ac: Add --with-packager & --with-packager-version args

	qemu: fix attach-interface regression
	QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS should be set in the function
	qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo()

	The flag QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS is used in the function
	qemuBuildDeviceAddressStr(). All callers get qemuCmdFlags
	by the function qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo() except that
	testCompareXMLToArgvFiles() in qemuxml2argvtest.c.

	So we should set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS in the function
	qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo() instead of qemuBuildCommandLine()
	because the function qemuBuildCommandLine() does not be called
	when we attach a pci device.

	tests: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS in testCompareXMLToArgvFiles()

	set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_PCI_MULTIBUS before calling qemuBuildCommandLine()
	as the flags is not set by qemuCapsExtractVersionInfo().

	Don't use CLONE_NEWUSER for now
	Until now, user namespaces have not done much, but (for that
	reason) have been innocuous to glob in with other CLONE_
	flags.  Upcoming userns development, however, will make tasks
	cloned with CLONE_NEWUSER far more restricted.  In particular,
	for some time they will be unable to access files with anything
	other than the world access perms.

	This patch assumes that noone really needs the user namespaces
	to be enabled.  If that is wrong, then we can try a more
	baroque patch where we create a file owned by a test userid with
	700 perms and, if we can't access it after setuid'ing to that
	userid, then return 0.  Otherwise, assume we are using an
	older, 'harmless' user namespace implementation.

	Comments appreciated.  Is it ok to do this?

	communication to qemu. Since the protocol is QMP with current qemu and
	HMP much more usable for humans, one ends up typing something like the
	following:

	    virsh qemu-monitor-command DOM \
	'{"execute":"human-monitor-command","arguments":{"command-line":"info kvm"}}'

	which is not a very convenient way of debugging qemu.

	This patch introduces --hmp option to qemu-monitor-command, which says
	that the provided command is in HMP. If libvirt uses QMP to talk with
	qemu, the command will automatically be converted into QMP. So the
	example above is simplified to just

	    virsh qemu-monitor-command --hmp DOM "info kvm"

	Also the result is converted from

	    {"return":"kvm support: enabled\r\n"}

	to just plain HMP:

	    kvm support: enabled

	If libvirt talks to qemu in HMP, --hmp flag is obviously a noop.

	qemu: avoid double shutdown
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c (qemudShutdownVMDaemon): Check that vm is
	still active.
	Reported by Wen Congyang as follows:

	Steps to reproduce this bug:

	1. use gdb to debug libvirtd, and set breakpoint in the function
	   qemuConnectMonitor()
	2. start a vm, and the libvirtd will be stopped in qemuConnectMonitor()
	3. kill -STOP $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)
	4. continue to run libvirtd in gdb, and libvirtd will be blocked in the
	   function qemuMonitorSetCapabilities()
	5. kill -9 $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)

	Here is log of the qemu:
	=========
	LC_ALL=C PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin ...
	char device redirected to /dev/pts/3
	2011-01-27 09:38:48.101: shutting down
	2011-01-27 09:41:26.401: shutting down
	=========

	The vm is shut down twice. I do not know whether this behavior has
	side effect, but I think we should shutdown the vm only once.

	Don't sleep in poll() if there is existing SASL decoded data
	In the SASL codepath we typically read far more data off the
	wire than we immediately need. When using a connection from a
	single thread this isn't a problem, since only our reply will
	be pending (or an event we can handle directly). When using a
	connection from multiple threads though, we may read the data
	from replies from other threads. If those replies occur after
	our own reply, they'll not be processed. The other thread will
	then go into poll() and wait for its reply which has already
	been received and decoded. The solution is to set poll() timeout
	to 0 if there is pending SASL data.

2011-01-29  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Add VIR_DIV_UP to divide memory or storage request sizes with round up
	Use it in all places where a memory or storage request size is converted
	to a larger granularity. This avoids requesting too small memory or storage
	sizes that could result from the truncation done by a simple division.

	This extends the round up fix in 6002e0406c338668ea0ecbfeb6c1ef20a8b67efe
	to the whole codebase.

	Instead of reporting errors for odd values in the VMX code round them up.

	Update the QEMU Argv tests accordingly as the original memory size 219200
	isn't a even multiple of 1024 and is rounded up to 215 megabyte now. Change
	it to 219100 and 219136. Use two different values intentionally to make
	sure that rounding up works.

	Update virsh.pod accordingly, as rounding down and rejecting are replaced
	by rounding up.

	Force guest suspend at timeout
	If the memory of guest OS is changed constantly, the live migration
	can not be ended ever for ever.

	We can use the command 'virsh migrate-setmaxdowntime' to control the
	live migration. But the value of maxdowntime is diffcult to calculate
	because it depends on the transfer speed of network and constantly
	changing memroy size. We need a easy way to control the live migration.

	This patch adds the support of forcing guest to suspend at timeout.
	With this patch, when we migrate the guest OS, we can specify a
	timeout. If the live migration timeouts, auto-suspend the guest OS,
	where the migration will complete offline.

	avoid vm to be deleted if qemuConnectMonitor failed
	Steps to reproduce this bug:
	1. service libvirtd start
	2. virsh start <domain>
	3. kill -STOP $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)
	4. service libvirtd restart
	5. kill -9 $(cat /var/run/libvirt/qemu/<domain>.pid)

	Then libvirtd will core dump or be in deadlock state.

	Make sure that json is built into libvirt and the version
	of qemu is newer than 0.13.0.

	The reason of libvirtd cores dump is that:
	We add vm->refs when we alloc the memory, and decrease it
	in the function qemuHandleMonitorEOF() in other thread.

	We add vm->refs in the function qemuConnectMonitor() and
	decrease it when the vm is inactive.

	The libvirtd will block in the function qemuMonitorSetCapabilities()
	because the vm is stopped by signal SIGSTOP. Now the vm->refs is 2.

	Then we kill the vm by signal SIGKILL. The function
	qemuMonitorSetCapabilities() failed, and then we will decrease vm->refs
	in the function qemuMonitorClose().
	In another thread, mon->fd is broken and the function
	qemuHandleMonitorEOF() is called.

	If qemuHandleMonitorEOF() decreases vm->refs before qemuConnectMonitor()
	returns, vm->refs will be decrease to 0 and the memory is freed.

	We will call qemudShutdownVMDaemon() as qemuConnectMonitor() failed.
	The memory has been freed, so qemudShutdownVMDaemon() is too dangerous.

	We will reference NULL pointer in the function virDomainConfVMNWFilterTeardown():
	=============
	void
	virDomainConfVMNWFilterTeardown(virDomainObjPtr vm) {
	    int i;

	    if (nwfilterDriver != NULL) {
	        for (i = 0; i < vm->def->nnets; i++)
	            virDomainConfNWFilterTeardown(vm->def->nets[i]);
	    }
	}
	============
	vm->def->nnets is not 0 but vm->def->nets is NULL(We don't set vm->def->nnets
	to 0 when we free vm).

	We should add an extra reference of vm to avoid vm to be deleted if
	qemuConnectMonitor() failed.

	event: fix event-handling allocation crash
	Regression introduced in commit e6b68d7 (Nov 2010).

	Prior to that point, handlesAlloc was always a multiple of
	EVENT_ALLOC_EXTENT (10), and was an int (so even if the subtraction
	had been able to wrap, a negative value would be less than the count
	not try to free the handles array).  But after that point,
	VIR_RESIZE_N made handlesAlloc grow geometrically (with a pattern of
	10, 20, 30, 45 for the handles array) but still freed in multiples of
	EVENT_ALLOC_EXTENT; and the count changed to size_t.  Which means that
	after 31 handles have been created, then 30 handles destroyed,
	handlesAlloc is 5 while handlesCount is 1, and since (size_t)(1 - 5)
	is indeed greater than 1, this then tried to free 10 elements, which
	had the awful effect of nuking the handles array while there were
	still live handles.

	Nuking live handles puts libvirtd in an inconsistent state, and was
	easily reproducible by starting and then stopping 60 faqemu guests.

	* daemon/event.c (virEventCleanupTimeouts, virEventCleanupHandles):
	Avoid integer wrap-around causing us to delete the entire array
	while entries are still active.

	Explanation : When an incoming migration is over a pipe (for example,
	if the image was compressed and is being fed through gzip, or was on a
	root-squash nfs server, so needed to be opened by a child process
	running as a different uid), qemu cannot read it unless the selinux
	context label for the pipe has been set properly.

	The solution is to check the fd used as the source of the migration
	just before passing it to qemu; if it's a fifo (implying that it's a
	pipe), we call the newly added virSecurityManagerSetFDLabel() function
	to set the context properly.

2011-01-26  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add a function to the security driver API that sets the label of an open fd.
	A need was found to set the SELinux context label on an open fd (a
	pipe, as a matter of fact). This patch adds a function to the security
	driver API that will set the label on an open fd to secdef.label. For
	all drivers other than the SELinux driver, it's a NOP. For the SElinux
	driver, it calls fsetfilecon().

	If the return is a failure, it only returns error up to the caller if
	1) the desired label is different from the existing label, 2) the
	destination fd is of a type that supports setting the selinux context,
	and 3) selinux is in enforcing mode. Otherwise it will return
	success. This follows the pattern of the existing function
	SELinuxSetFilecon().

	build: avoid corrupted gnulib/tests/Makefile
	Running 'make check' can sometimes fail in the gnulib/tests

	qemu: sound: Support intel 'ich6' model
	In QEMU, the card itself is a PCI device, but it requires a codec
	(either -device hda-output or -device hda-duplex) to actually output
	sound. Specifying <sound model='ich6'/> gives us -device intel-hda
	-device hda-duplex I think it's important that a simple <sound model='ich6'/>
	sets up a useful codec, to have consistent behavior with all other sound cards.

	This is basically Dan's proposal of

	    <sound model='ich6'>
	        <codec type='output' slot='0'/>
	        <codec type='duplex' slot='3'/>
	    </sound>

	without the codec bits implemented.

	The important thing is to keep a consistent API here, we don't want some
	<sound> devs require tweaking codecs but not others. Steps I see to
	accomplishing this:

	    - every <sound> device has a <codec type='default'/> (unless codecs are
	        manually specified)
	    - <codec type='none'/> is required to specify 'no codecs'
	    - new audio settings like mic=on|off could then be exposed in
	        <sound> or <codec> in a consistent manner for all sound models

	v2:
	    Use model='ich6'

	v3:
	    Use feature detection, from eblake
	    Set codec id, bus, and cad values

	v4:
	    intel-hda isn't supported if -device isn't available

	event: fix event-handling data race
	This bug has been present since before the time that commit

	Dereferencing eventLoop.handles outside the lock risks crashing, since
	any other thread could have reallocated the array in the meantime.

	Enable tuning of qemu network tap device "sndbuf" size
	This is in response to a request in:

	   https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=665293

	In short, under heavy load, it's possible for qemu's networking to
	lock up due to the tap device's default 1MB sndbuf being
	inadequate. adding "sndbuf=0" to the qemu commandline -netdevice
	option will alleviate this problem (sndbuf=0 actually sets it to
	0xffffffff).

	Because we must be able to explicitly specify "0" as a value, the
	standard practice of "0 means not specified" won't work here. Instead,
	virDomainNetDef also has a sndbuf_specified, which defaults to 0, but
	is set to 1 if some value was given.

	The sndbuf value is put inside a <tune> element of each <interface> in
	the domain. The intent is that further tunable settings will also be
	placed inside this element.

	     <interface type='network'>
	       ...
	       <tune>
	         <sndbuf>0</sndbuf>

	Add XML config switch to enable/disable vhost-net support
	This patch is in response to

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=643050

	The existing libvirt support for the vhost-net backend to the virtio
	network driver happens automatically - if the vhost-net device is
	available, it is always enabled, otherwise the standard userland
	virtio backend is used.

	This patch makes it possible to force whether or not vhost-net is used
	with a bit of XML. Adding a <driver> element to the interface XML, eg:

	     <interface type="network">
	       <model type="virtio"/>
	       <driver name="vhost"/>

	will force use of vhost-net (if it's not available, the domain will
	fail to start). if driver name="qemu", vhost-net will not be used even
	if it is available.

	If there is no <driver name='xxx'/> in the config, libvirt will revert
	to the pre-existing automatic behavior - use vhost-net if it's
	available, and userland backend if vhost-net isn't available.

	Fix 'make check' after commit 04197350
	I broke 'make check' with commit 04197350 by unconditionally
	emitting 'hap=' in xen xm driver.  Only emit 'hap=' if
	xendConfigVersion >= 3.  I've tested sending 'hap=' to a Xen 3.2

	qemu: Watchdog IB700 is not a PCI device (RHBZ#667091).
	Skip IB700 when assigning PCI slots.

	Note: the I6300ESB watchdog _is_ a PCI device.

	To test this: I applied this patch to libvirt-0.8.3-2.fc14 (rebasing
	it slightly: qemu_command.c didn't exist in that version) and
	installed this on my machine, then tested that I could successfully
	add an ib700 watchdog device to a guest, start the guest, and the
	ib700 was available to the guest.  I also added an i6300esb (PCI)
	watchdog to another guest, and verified that libvirt assigned a PCI
	device to it, that the guest could be started, and that i6300esb was
	present in the guest.

	Note that if you previously had a domain with a ib700 watchdog, it
	would have had an <address type='pci' .../> clause added to it in the
	libvirt configuration.  This patch does not attempt to remove this.
	You cannot start such a domain -- qemu gives an error if you try.
	With this patch you are able to remove the bogus address element
	without libvirt adding it back.

	remote: Don't lose track of events when callbacks are slow
	After the remote driver runs an event callback, it unconditionally disables the
	loop timer, thinking it just flushed every queued event. This doesn't work
	correctly though if an event is queued while a callback is running.

	The events actually aren't being lost, it's just that the event loop didn't
	think there was anything that needed to be dispatched. So all those 'lost
	events' should actually get re-triggered if you manually kick the loop by
	generating a new event (like creating a new guest).

	The solution is to disable the dispatch timer _before_ we invoke any event
	callbacks. Events queued while a callback is running will properly reenable the
	timer.

2011-01-11  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor the security drivers to simplify usage
	The current security driver usage requires horrible code like

	    if (driver->securityDriver &&
	        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel &&
	        driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
	                                                              vm, hostdev) < 0)

	This pair of checks for NULL clutters up the code, making the driver
	calls 2 lines longer than they really need to be. The goal of the
	patchset is to change the calling convention to simply

	  if (virSecurityManagerSetHostdevLabel(driver->securityDriver,
	                                        vm, hostdev) < 0)

	The first check for 'driver->securityDriver' being NULL is removed
	by introducing a 'no op' security driver that will always be present
	if no real driver is enabled. This guarentees driver->securityDriver
	!= NULL.

	The second check for 'driver->securityDriver->domainSetSecurityHostdevLabel'
	being non-NULL is hidden in a new abstraction called virSecurityManager.
	This separates the driver callbacks, from main internal API. The addition
	of a virSecurityManager object, that is separate from the virSecurityDriver
	struct also allows for security drivers to carry state / configuration
	information directly. Thus the DAC/Stack drivers from src/qemu which
	used to pull config from 'struct qemud_driver' can now be moved into
	the 'src/security' directory and store their config directly.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Update to
	  use new virSecurityManager APIs
	* src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c,  src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.h

	daemon: Fix core dumps if unix_sock_group is set
	Setting unix_sock_group to something else than default "root" in
	/etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf prevents system libvirtd from dumping core on
	crash. This is because we used setgid(unix_sock_group) before binding to
	/var/run/libvirt/libvirt-sock* and setgid() back to original group.
	However, if a process changes its effective or filesystem group ID, it
	will be forbidden from leaving core dumps unless fs.suid_dumpable sysctl
	is set to something else then 0 (and it is 0 by default).

	Changing socket's group ownership after bind works better. And we can do
	so without introducing a race condition since we loosen access rights by
	changing the group from root to something else.

	from using inet_pton() to using virSocketParseAddr(), but the absence
	of an ip address in a dhcp static host definition was still silently
	ignored (and that entry discarded from the saved XML). This patch
	turns that into a logged failure; likewise if the entry has neither a
	mac address nor a name attribute (the entry is useless without at
	least one of those, plus an ip address).

	Since the network name is now pulled into this function in order for
	those error logs to be more informative, the other error messages in
	the function have also been changed to take advantage.

	qemu driver: fix positioning to end of log file
	While doing some testing with Qemu and creating huge logfiles I encountered the case where the VM could not start anymore due to the lseek() to the end of the Qemu VM's log file failing. The patch below fixes the problem by replacing the previously used 'int' with 'off_t'.

	To reproduce this error, you could do the following:

	dd if=/dev/zero of=/var/log/libvirt/qemu/<name of VM>.log bs=1024 count=$((1024*2048))

	and you should get an error like this:

	error: Failed to start domain <name of VM>
	error: Unable to seek to -2147482651 in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/<name of VM>.log: Success

	The udev driver does not update a PCI device with its SR-IOV capabilities,

	Improve virSocketAddrMask[ByPrefix] API
	The original version of these functions would modify the address sent
	in, meaning that the caller would usually need to copy the address
	first. This change makes the original a const, and puts the resulting
	masked address into a new arg (which could point to the same
	virSocketAddr as the original, if the caller really wants to modify
	it).

	This also makes the API consistent with virSocketAddrBroadcast[ByPrefix].

	Set broadcast address for IPv4 addresses on virtual network bridges
	Previously we used ioctl() to set the IP address and netmask of the
	bridges used for virtual networks, and apparently the SIOCSIFNETMASK
	ioctl implicitly set the broadcast address for the interface. The new
	method of using the "ip" command requires broadcast address to be
	explicitly specified though.

	Utility functions to produce an IPv4 broadcast address
	These functions work only for IPv4, becasue IPv6 doesn't have the same
	concept of "broadcast address" as IPv4. They merely OR the inverse of
	the netmask with the given host address, thus turning on all the host
	bits.

	bridge: Fix uninitialized variable

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Replace setuid/setgid/initgroups with virSetUIDGID()
	This patch fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=664406

	If qemu is run as a different uid, it has been unable to access mode
	0660 files that are owned by a different user, but with a group that
	the qemu is a member of (aside from the one group listed in the passwd
	file), because initgroups() is not being called prior to the
	exec. initgroups will change the group membership of the process (and
	its children) to match the new uid.

	To make this happen, the setregid()/setreuid() code in
	qemuSecurityDACSetProcessLabel has been replaced with a call to
	virSetUIDGID(), which does both of those, plus calls initgroups.

	Similar, but not identical, code in qemudOpenAsUID() has been replaced
	with virSetUIDGID(). This not only consolidates the functionality to a
	single location, but also potentially fixes some as-yet unreported
	bugs.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	new virSetUIDGID() utility function
	virSetUIDGID() sets both the real and effective group and user of the
	process, and additionally calls initgroups() to assure that the
	process joins all the auxiliary groups that the given uid is a member
	of.

	Preserve errno across calls to error reporting functions & VIR_FREE
	There are cases when we want log an error message, and possibly free
	some memory as part of the cleanup, while still preserving errno for a
	caller, but the functions that log errors, and virFree (VIR_FREE) make
	system calls that will clear errno. This patch preserves errno during
	those most basic functions (corresponding to virReportSystemError(),
	virReportOOMError(), networkReportError(), etc, as well as
	virStrError()). It does *not preserve errno across calls to higher
	level items such as virDispatchError(), as it's assumed the caller is
	all finished with any need for errno by the time it dispatches the
	error.

	Run radvd for virtual networks with IPv6 addresses
	Running an instance of the router advertisement daemon (radvd) allows
	guests using the virtual network to automatically acquire an IPv6
	address and default route. Note that acquiring an address only works
	for networks with a prefix length of exactly 64 - radvd is still run
	in other circumstances, and still advertises routes, but autoconf will
	not work because it requires exactly 64 bits of address info from the
	network prefix.

	This patch avoids a race condition with the pidfile by manually
	daemonizing radvd rather than allowing it to daemonize itself, then
	creating our own pidfile (in addition to radvd's own file, which is
	unnecessary, but there is no way to tell radvd to not create it). This
	is accomplished by exec'ing it with "--debug 1" in the commandline,
	and using virCommand's features to fork, create a pidfile, and detach
	from the newly forked process.

	Turn on IPv6 support in the bridge_driver.c virtual network driver
	At this point everything is already in place to make IPv6 happen, we just

	the changes to the XML on the website.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Update iptables.c to also support ip6tables.
	All of the iptables functions eventually call down to a single
	bottom-level function, and fortunately, ip6tables syntax (for all the
	args that we use) is identical to iptables format (except the
	addresses), so all we need to do is:

	1) Get an address family down to the lowest level function in each
	   case, either implied through an address, or explicitly when no
	   address is in the parameter list, and

	2) At the lowest level, just decide whether to call "iptables" or
	   "ip6tables" based on the family.

	The location of the ip6tables binary is determined at build time by
	autoconf. If a particular target system happens to not have ip6tables
	installed, any attempts to run it will generate an error, but that
	won't happen unless someone tries to define an IPv6 address for a
	network. This is identical behavior to IPv4 addresses and iptables.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Support multiple IP addresses on one network in bridge_driver.c
	This patch reorganizes the code in bridge_driver.c to account for the
	concept of a single network with multiple IP addresses, without adding
	in the extra variable of IPv6. A small bit of code has been
	temporarily added that checks all given addresses to verify they are
	IPv4 - this will be removed when full IPv6 support is turned on.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Change virtual network XML parsing/formatting to support IPv6
	This commit adds support for IPv6 parsing and formatting to the
	virtual network XML parser, including moving around data definitions
	to allow for multiple <ip> elements on a single network, but only
	changes the consumers of this API to accommodate for the changes in
	API/structure, not to add any actual IPv6 functionality. That will
	come in a later patch - this patch attempts to maintain the same final
	functionality in both drivers that use the network XML parser - vbox
	and "bridge" (the Linux bridge-based driver used by the qemu
	hypervisor driver).

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Add new private API functions.
	* src/conf/network_conf.[ch]: Change C data structure and
	  parsing/formatting.
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Update to use new parser/formatter.
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: update to use new parser/formatter
	* docs/schemas/network.rng: changes to the schema -
	  * there can now be more than one <ip> element.
	  * ip address is now an ip-addr (ipv4 or ipv6) rather than ipv4-addr
	  * new optional "prefix" attribute that can be used in place of "netmask"
	  * new optional "family" attribute - "ipv4" or "ipv6"
	    (will default to ipv4)
	  * define data types for the above
	* tests/networkxml2xml(in|out)/nat-network.xml: add multiple <ip> elements
	  (including IPv6) to a single network definition to verify they are being
	  correctly parsed and formatted.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	make the <dhcp> element optional in network.rng
	In practice this has always been optional, but the RNG has shown it as
	mandatory, and since all the examples for make check had it, it was
	never noticed. One of the existing test cases has been changed to
	check for this.

	I also noticed that the dhcp/host/ip was still defined as <text/>,
	but should really be <ref name='ipv4-addr'/>

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Replace brSetInetAddress/brSetInetNetmask with brAddInetAddress
	brSetInetAddress can only set a single IP address on the bridge, and
	uses a method (ioctl(SIOCSETIFADDR)) that only works for IPv4. Replace
	it and brSetInetNetmask with a single function that uses the external
	"ip addr add" command to add an address/prefix to the interface - this
	supports IPv6, and allows adding multiple addresses to the interface.

	Although it isn't currently used in the code, we also add a
	brDelInetAddress for completeness' sake.

	Also, while we're modifying bridge.c, we change brSetForwardDelay and
	brSetEnableSTP to use the new virCommand API rather than the
	deprecated virRun, and also log an error message in bridge_driver.c if
	either of those fail (previously the failure would be completely
	silent).

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Make virtual network netmasks optional
	When a netmask isn't specified for an IPv4 address, one can be implied
	based on what network class range the address is in. The
	virNetworkDefPrefix function does this for us, so netmask isn't
	required.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Pass prefix rather than netmask into iptables functions
	IPv6 will use prefix exclusively, and IPv4 will also optionally be
	able to use it, and the iptables functions really need a prefix
	anyway, so use the new virNetworkDefPrefix() function to send prefixes
	into iptables functions instead of netmasks.

	Also, in a couple places where a netmask is actually needed, use the
	new private API function for it rather than getting it directly. This
	will allow for cases where no netmask or prefix is specified (it
	returns the default for the current class of network.)

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Consistently return 0 on success, -1 on failure in bridge_driver.c
	Some functions in this file were returning 1 on success and 0 on
	failure, and others were returning 0 on success and -1 on
	failure. Switch them all to return the libvirt-preferred 0/-1.

	Fix logging of failed iptables commands
	The functions in iptables.c all return -1 on failure, but all their
	callers (which all happen to be in bridge_driver.c) assume that they
	are returning an errno, and the logging is done accordingly. This
	patch fixes all the error checking and logging to assume < 0 is an
	error, and nothing else.

2010-12-24  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	New virNetworkDef utility functions
	Later patches will add the possibility to define a network's netmask
	as a prefix (0-32, or 0-128 in the case of IPv6). To make it easier to
	deal with definition of both kinds (prefix or netmask), add two new
	functions:

	virNetworkDefNetmask: return a copy of the netmask into a
	virSocketAddr. If no netmask was specified in the XML, create a
	default netmask based on the network class of the virNetworkDef's IP
	address.

	virNetworkDefPrefix: return the netmask as numeric prefix (or the
	default prefix for the network class of the virNetworkDef's IP
	address, if no netmask was specified in the XML)

	virSocketAddrMask: Mask off the host bits in one virSocketAddr
	according to the netmask in another virSocketAddr.

2010-12-18  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	vbox: Don't leak arrays from XPCOM
	XPCOM returns an array as a pointer to an array of pointers to the

	released, but the actual array containing the pointers to the items
	was not freed and leaked.

	Free the actual array using ComUnallocMem.

	cpu: Unify CPUID data structures
	So far, CPUID data were stored in two different data structures. First
	of them was a structure allowing direct access for CPUID data according
	to function number and the second was a plain array of struct
	cpuX86cpuid. This was a silly design which resulted in converting data
	from one type to the other and back again or implementing similar
	functionality for both data structures.

	The patch leaves only the direct access structure. This makes the code
	both smaller and more maintainable since operations on different objects
	can use common low-level operations.

	All 57 tests for cpu subsystem still pass after this rewrite.

	qemu: Introduce two new job types
	Currently, all of domain "save/dump/managed save/migration"
	use the same function "qemudDomainWaitForMigrationComplete"
	to wait the job finished, but the error messages are all
	about "migration", e.g. when a domain saving job is canceled
	by user, "migration was cancled by client" will be throwed as
	an error message, which will be confused for user.

	As a solution, intoduce two new job types(QEMU_JOB_SAVE,
	QEMU_JOB_DUMP), and set "priv->jobActive" to "QEMU_JOB_SAVE"
	before saving, to "QEMU_JOB_DUMP" before dumping, so that we
	could get the real job type in
	"qemudDomainWaitForMigrationComplete", and give more clear
	message further.

	And as It's not important to figure out what's the exact job
	is in the DEBUG and WARN log, also we don't need translated
	string in logs, simply repace "migration" with "job" in some
	statements.

	Convert dhcpStartDhcpDaemon from virRun to virCommand
	This is pretty straightforward - even though dnsmasq gets daemonized
	and uses a pid file, those things are both handled by the dnsmasq
	binary itself. And libvirt doesn't need any of the output of the
	dnsmasq command either, so we just setup the args and call
	virRun(). Mainly it was just a (mostly) mechanical job of replacing
	the APPEND_ARG() macro (and some other *printfs()) with
	virCommandAddArg*().

	qemu: Distinguish between domain shutdown and crash
	When we get an EOF event on monitor connection, it may be a result of
	either crash or graceful shutdown. QEMU which supports async events
	(i.e., we are talking to it using JSON monitor) emits SHUTDOWN event on
	graceful shutdown. In case we don't get this event by the time monitor
	connection is closed, we assume the associated domain crashed.

	qemu: call drive_del in DetachPciDiskDevice
	Currently libvirt doesn't confirm whether the guest has responded to the
	disk removal request.  In some cases this can leave the guest with
	continued access to the device while the mgmt layer believes that it has
	been removed.  With a recent qemu monitor command[1] we can
	deterministically revoke a guests access to the disk (on the QEMU side)
	to ensure no futher access is permitted.

	This patch adds support for the drive_del() command and introduces it
	in the disk removal paths.  If the guest is running in a QEMU without this
	command we currently explicitly check for unknown command/CommandNotFound
	and log the issue.

	If QEMU supports the command we issue the drive_del command after we attempt
	to remove the device.  The guest may respond and remove the block device
	before we get to attempt to call drive_del.  In that case, we explicitly check
	for 'Device not found' from the monitor indicating that the target drive
	was auto-deleted upon guest responds to the device removal notification.

	Changes since v2:
	 - use VIR_ERROR to report when unplug command not found

	qemu: avoid adding "" in smbios arguments
	The log lists things like -smbios type=1,vendor="Red Hat", which
	is great for shell parsing, but not so great when you realize that
	execve() then passes those literal "" on as part of the command
	line argument, such that qemu sets SMBIOS with extra literal quotes.

	The eventual addition of virCommand is needed before we have the API
	to shell-quote a string representation of a command line, so that the
	log can still be pasted into a shell, but without inserting extra
	bytes into the execve() arguments.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c (qemuBuildSmbiosBiosStr)
	(qemuBuildSmbiosSystemStr): Qemu doesn't like quotes around uuid
	arguments, and the remaining quotes are passed literally to

	quotes makes the log harder to parse, but that can be fixed later
	with virCommand improvements.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-smbios.args: 'Fix' test; it
	will need fixing again once virCommand learns how to shell-quote a
	potential command line.

2010-12-02  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	tests: Support for faking emulator in qemuxml2argv
	This patch allows for using custom scripts instead of /usr/bin/qemu
	emulator in domain XML. To do so, one would specify relative path to the
	custom script in <emulator/>. The path needs to be relative to
	qemuxml2argvdata directory and it will be transparently made absolute in
	runtime. The expected command line needs to contain the exact relative
	path as was used in domain XML.

	The problem is RelaxNG schema for domain XML only allows for absolute
	path within <emulator/>. To workaround it, an extra '/' must be added at
	the beginning of the path. That is, instead of "./qemu.sh" or
	"../emulator/qemu.sh" one would use "/./qemu.sh" or
	"/../emulator/qemu.sh". The extra slash is removed before further
	processing. I don't like this workaround, it's very ugly but it's the
	best option I was able to come up with. Relaxing domain XML schema is

	802.1Qbg: use pre-associate state at beginning of inc. migr
	This patch introduces the usage of the pre-associate state of the IEEE 802.1Qbg standard on incoming VM migration on the target host. It is in response to bugzilla entry 632750.

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=632750

	For being able to differentiate the exact reason as to why a macvtap device is being created, either due to a VM creation or an incoming VM migration, I needed to pass that reason as a parameter from wherever qemudStartVMDaemon is being called in order to determine whether to send an ASSOCIATE (VM creation) or a PRE-ASSOCIATE (incoming VM migration) towards lldpad.

	I am also fixing a problem with the virsh domainxml-to-native call on the way.

	Gerhard successfully tested the patch with a recent blade network 802.1Qbg-compliant switch.

	The patch should not have any side-effects on the 802.1Qbh support in libvirt, but Roopa (cc'ed) may want to verify this.

2010-11-25  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Fix host CPU counting on unusual NUMA topologies
	The nodeinfo structure includes

	    nodes   : the number of NUMA cell, 1 for uniform mem access
	    sockets : number of CPU socket per node
	    cores   : number of core per socket
	    threads : number of threads per core

	which does not work well for NUMA topologies where each node does not
	consist of integral number of CPU sockets.

	We also have VIR_NODEINFO_MAXCPUS macro in public libvirt.h which
	computes maximum number of CPUs as (nodes * sockets * cores * threads).

	As a result, we can't just change sockets to report total number of
	sockets instead of sockets per node. This would probably be the easiest
	since I doubt anyone is using the field directly. But because of the
	macro, some apps might be using sockets indirectly.

	This patch leaves sockets to be the number of CPU sockets per node (and
	fixes qemu driver to comply with this) on machines where sockets can be
	divided by nodes. If we can't divide sockets by nodes, we behave as if
	there was just one NUMA node containing all sockets. Apps interested in
	NUMA should consult capabilities XML, which is what they probably do
	anyway.

	This way, the only case in which apps that care about NUMA may break is
	on machines with funky NUMA topology. And there is a chance libvirt
	wasn't able to start any guests on those machines anyway (although it
	depends on the topology, total number of CPUs and kernel version).
	Nothing changes at all for apps that don't care about NUMA.

	security, storage: plug memory leaks for security_context_t
	security_context_t happens to be a typedef for char*, and happens to

	Always close drivers when a virConnectPtr is released
	virConnectClose calls virUnrefConnect which in turn closes
	all open drivers when the refcount of that connection dropped
	to zero. This works fine when you free all other objects that
	hold a ref to the connection before you close it, because in
	this case virUnrefConnect is the one that removes the last
	ref to the connection.

	But it doesn't work when you close the connection first before
	freeing the other objects. This is because the other virUnref*
	functions call virReleaseConnect when they detect that the
	connection's refcount dropped to zero. In this case another
	virUnref* function (different from virUnrefConnect) removes the
	last ref to the connection. This results in not closing the
	open drivers and leaking things that should have been cleaned
	up in the driver close functions.

	To fix this move the driver close calls to virReleaseConnect.

	remote: Fix TLS transport on Windows

	into file descriptor based ones that are used in libvirt.

	Even though GnuTLS is using gnulib too, it explicitly doesn't use
	gnulib's replacement functions on Windows. By default GnuTLS uses the
	SOCKET handle based send() and recv(). This makes gnutls_handshake()
	fail internally with a WSAENOTSOCK error because libvirt passes a
	file descriptor; GnuTLS needs the SOCKET handle.

	To avoid this mismatch make sure that GnuTLS uses gnulib's replacment

	Improve SCSI volume name generation
	The SCSI volumes currently get a name like '17:0:0:1' based
	on $host:$bus:$target:$lun. The names are intended to be unique
	per pool and stable across pool restarts. The inclusion of the
	$host component breaks this, because the $host number for iSCSI
	pools is dynamically allocated by the kernel at time of login.
	This changes the name to be 'unit:0:0:1', ie removes the leading
	host component. The 'unit:' prefix is just to ensure the volume
	name doesn't start with a number and make it clearer when seen

	Stop iSCSI targets automatically logging back in after logout
	The Linux iSCSI initiator toolchain has the dubious feature that
	if you ever run the 'sendtargets' command to merely query what
	targets are available from a server, the results will be recorded
	in /var/lib/iscsi. Any time the '/etc/init.d/iscsi' script runs
	in the future, it will then automatically login to all those
	targets. /etc/init.d/iscsi is automatically run whenever a NIC
	comes online.

	So from the moment you ask a server what targets are available,
	your client will forever more automatically try to login to all
	targets without ever asking if you actually want it todo this.

	To stop this stupid behaviour, we need to run

	  iscsiadm --portal $PORTAL --target $TARGET
	   --op update --name node.startup --value manual

	For every target on the server.

	Ensure logfile isn't truncated by shutdown message.
	When running non-root, the QEMU log file is usually opened with
	truncation, since there is no logrotate for non-root usage.
	This means that when libvirt logs the shutdown timestamp, the
	log is accidentally truncated

	qemu: setvcpus: Save config changes to disk
	Currently changes to the persistent config aren't flushed to disk, meaning
	they are lost if the domain is redefined or libvirtd is restarted.

2010-11-23  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	qemu: setvcpus: Simplify altering the persistent config
	Do this by adding a helper function to get the persistent domain config. This
	should be useful for other functions that may eventually want to alter
	the persistent domain config (attach/detach device). Also make similar changes
	to the test drivers setvcpus command.

	A caveat is that the function will return the running config for a transient
	domain, rather than error. This simplifies callers, as long as they use
	other methods to ensure the guest is persistent.

	qemu: setvcpus: Fix maxvcpus check
	Doing 'virsh setvcpus $vm --config 10' doesn't check the value against the

	Also make a similar change to the test driver.

	conf: domain: Improve vcpus validation reporting

2010-11-23  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	Make state driver device hotplug/update actually transient
	The current semantics of non-persistent hotplug/update are confusing: the
	changes will persist as long as the in memory domain definition isn't
	overwritten. This means hotplug changes stay around until the domain is
	redefined or libvirtd is restarted.

	Call virDomainObjSetDefTransient at VM startup, so that we properly discard
	hotplug changes when the VM is shutdown.

2010-11-23  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	domain_conf: Add virDomainObjSetDefTransient
	This function sets the running domain definition as transient, by reparsing
	the persistent config and assigning it to newDef. This ensures that any
	changes made to the running definition and not the persistent config are
	discarded when the VM is shutdown.

	xend: Escape reserved sexpr characters
	If we don't escape ' or \ xend can't parse the generated sexpr. This
	might over apply the EscapeSexpr routine, but it shouldn't hurt.

	buf: Simplify virBufferEscapeString
	We are about to copy this function, so clean it up before we do.

	xend: urlencode: Properly escape '&'
	Since we send the sexpr to xend via HTTP, we need to properly escape
	'&'

	conf: Fix parsing python style triple quotes
	An incorrect check broke matching the closing set of quotes. Update
	tests to cover this case for XM config files.

	conf: Convert ParseString to use STRPREFIX

	Allow probing of image formats without version information
	Disk image formats that wish to opt-out of version validation are supposed to
	set versionOffset to -1 in their fileTypeInfo entry.

	By unconditionally returning False for these formats,
	virStorageFileMatchesVersion() incorrectly reports a version mismatch when the
	test was actually skipped.  The correct behavior is to return True so these

	maint: tighten strncmp syntax check
	Using 'int ret = strcmp(a, b)' in a qsort function is a valid use of
	str[n]cmp that should _not_ be turned to STREQ, but it was falling
	foul of our specific syntax-check.  Meanwhile, gnulib's maint.mk
	already has a tighter bound for strcmp, so we can copy that regex and

	require exceptions.

	gettext() doesn't work correctly on all platforms unless you have

	override the main program's default domain (virInitialize already
	calls bindtextdomain(), but this is insufficient without the
	setlocale() added in this patch; and a redundant bindtextdomain()
	in this patch doesn't hurt, but serves as a good example for other
	packages that need to bind a second translation domain).

	replace last instances of close()
	I am replacing the last instances of close() I found with VIR_CLOSE() / VIR_FORCE_CLOSE respectively.

	The first part patches virsh, which I missed out on previously.

	The 2nd patch I had left out intentionally to look at it more carefully:
	The 'closed' variable could be easily removed since it wasn't used anywhere else. The possible race condition that could result from the filedescriptor being closed and not set to -1 (and possibly let us write into 'something' totally different if the fd was allocated by another thread) seems to be prevented by the qemuMonitorLock() already placed around the code that reads from or writes to the fd. So the change of this code as shown in the patch should not have any side-effects.

	Put network.rng contents inside <grammar> for uniformity with other RNGs
	All the other RNG files in libvirt are enclosed within <grammar>. This
	commit makes the syntactical changes necessary to make network.rng fit
	that pattern. (This is the first step in adding some data type
	definitions to network.rng for more exact validation of IP and MAC
	addresses).

	Formatting changes (indentation) will be done in a subsequent commit,
	so that actual changes to the code won't be obscured by whitespace.

	virt-aa-helper should require <uuid> in XML
	When <uuid> is not in the XML, a virUUIDGenerate() ends up being called which
	is unnecessary and can lead to crashes if /dev/urandom isn't available
	because virRandomInitialize() is not called within virt-aa-helper. This patch
	adds verify_xpath_context() and updates caps_mockup() to use it.

2010-11-12  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	ignore SELinuxSetFilecon error in SELinuxSetSecurityFileLabel if on nfs
	If virDomainAttachDevice() was called with an image that was located
	on a root-squashed NFS server, and in a directory that was unreadable
	by root on the machine running libvirtd, the attach would fail due to
	an attempt to change the selinux label of the image with EACCES (which
	isn't covered as an ignore case in SELinuxSetFilecon())

	NFS doesn't support SELinux labelling anyway, so we mimic the failure
	handling of commit 93a18bbafaf11729d3ca1241e11bee133d77fa77, which
	just ignores the errors if the target is on an NFS filesystem (in
	SELinuxSetSecurityAllLabel() only, though.)

	This can be seen as a follow-on to commit
	347d266c51705f4987fa5ce2a0ecb314ed8745ce, which ignores file open
	failures of files on NFS that occur directly in
	virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() (also necessary), but does not ignore
	failures in functions that are called from there (eg
	SELinuxSetSecurityFileLabel()).

	This adds supported for the stream callbacks and non-blocking
	I/O. with the minor caveat is that it doesn't actually do

	Allow non-file disk backingStores
	I am trying to use a qcow image with libvirt where the backing 'file' is a
	qemu-nbd server.  Unfortunately virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() assumes that
	backingStore is always a real file so something like 'nbd:0:3333' is rejected
	because a file with that name cannot be accessed.  Note that I am not worried
	about directly using nbd images.  That would require a new disk type with XML
	markup, etc.  I only want it to be permitted as a backingStore

	The following patch implements danpb's suggestion:
	> I think I'm inclined to push the logic for skipping NBD one stage higher.
	> I'd rather expect virStorageFileGetMetadata() to return all backing
	> stores, even if not files. The virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() method
	> should definitely ignore non-file backing stores though.
	>
	> So what I'm thinking is to extend the virStorageFileMetadata struct and
	> just add a 'bool isFile' field to it. Default this field to true, unless
	> you see the prefix of nbd: in which case set it to false. The
	> virDomainDiskDefForeachPath() method can then skip over any backing
	> store with isFile == false

	xencapstest: Don't fail when Xen is installed
	xencapstest calls xenHypervisorMakeCapabilitiesInternal with conn == NULL
	which calls xenDaemonNodeGetTopology with conn == NULL when a recent
	enough Xen was detected (sys_interface_version >= SYS_IFACE_MIN_VERS_NUMA).
	But xenDaemonNodeGetTopology insists in having conn != NULL and fails,
	because it expects to be able to talk to an actual xend.

	We cannot do that in a 'make check' test. Therefore, only call the xend
	subdriver function when conn isn't NULL.

	macvtap: libvirtd forgot macvtap dev name when restarted
	During a shutdown/restart cycle libvirtd forgot the macvtap device name that it had created on behalf of a VM so that a stale macvtap device remained on the host when the VM terminated. Libvirtd has to actively tear down a macvtap device and it uses its name for identifying which device to tear down.

	The solution is to not blank out the <target dev='...'/> completely, but only blank it out on VMs that are not active. So, if a VM is active, the device name makes it into the XML and is also being parsed. If a VM is not active, the device name is discarded.

	Fix virPipeReadUntilEOF on more than 1024 bytes of data
	virPipeReadUntilEOF is used to read the stdout of exec'ed
	and this could fail to capture the full output and read only
	1024 bytes.
	  The problem is that this is based on a poll loop, and in the
	loop we read at most 1024 bytes per file descriptor, but we also
	note in the loop if poll indicates that the process won't output
	more than that on that fd by setting finished[i] = 1.
	  The simplest way is that if we read a full buffer make sure
	finished[i] is still 0 because we will need another pass in the
	loop.

	qemu: check compression program availability of virsh save and dump

2010-10-30  KAMEZAWA Hiroyuki  <kamezawa.hiroyu@jp.fujitsu.com>

	add compression support for "virsh dump"
	Add dump_image_format[] to qemu.conf and support compressed dump
	at virsh dump. coredump compression is important for saving disk space
	in an environment where multiple guests run.

	In general, "disk space for dump" is specially allocated and will be
	a dead space in the system. It's used only at emergency. So, it's better
	to have both of save_image_format and dump_image_format. "save" is done
	in scheduled manner with enough calculated disk space for it.

	This code reuses some of save_image_format[] and supports the same format.

	Changelog:
	 - modified libvirtd_qemu.aug
	 - modified test_libvirtd_qemu.aug
	 - fixed error handling of qemudSaveCompressionTypeFromString()

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't try to parse a NULL ip address for boot server
	The boot server IP address is optional, so it needs to be
	checked before attempting to parse it.

	* src/conf/network_conf.c: Don't parse NULL ip address for
	  boot server

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert virNetwork to use virSocketAddr everywhere
	Instead of storing the IP address string in virNetwork related
	structs, store the parsed virSocketAddr. This will make it
	easier to add IPv6 support in the future, by letting driver
	code directly check what address family is present

	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/conf/network_conf.h,
	  src/network/bridge_driver.c: Convert to use virSocketAddr
	  in virNetwork, instead of char *.
	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h,
	  src/util/dnsmasq.c, src/util/dnsmasq.h,
	  src/util/iptables.c, src/util/iptables.h: Convert to
	  take a virSocketAddr instead of char * for any IP
	  address parameters
	* src/util/network.h: Add macros to determine if an address
	  is set, and what address family is set.

	Include socket address in client probe data
	It is useful to know where the client is connecting from,
	so include the socket address in probe data.

	* daemon/libvirtd.h: Use virSocketAddr for storing client
	  address and keep printable address handy for logging
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Include socket address in client
	  connect/disconnect probes
	* daemon/probes.d: Add socket address to probes
	* examples/systemtap/client.stp: Print socket address
	* src/util/network.h: Add sockaddr_un to virSocketAddr union

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add dtrace static probes in libvirtd
	Adds initial support for dtrace static probes in libvirtd
	daemon, assuming use of systemtap dtrace compat shim on
	Linux. The probes are inserted for network client connect,
	disconnect, TLS handshake states and authentication protocol
	states.

	This can be tested by running the xample program and then
	attempting to connect with any libvirt client (virsh,
	virt-manager, etc).

	 # stap examples/systemtap/client.stp
	  Client fd=44 connected readonly=0
	  Client fd=44 auth polkit deny pid:24997,uid:500
	  Client fd=44 disconnected
	  Client fd=46 connected readonly=1
	  Client fd=46 auth sasl allow test
	  Client fd=46 disconnected

	The libvirtd.stp file should also really not be required,
	since it is duplicated info that is already available in
	the main probes.d definition file. A script to autogenerate
	the .stp file is needed, either in libvirtd tree, or better
	as part of systemtap itself.

	* Makefile.am: Add examples/systemtap subdir
	* autobuild.sh: Disable dtrace for mingw32
	* configure.ac: Add check for dtrace
	* daemon/.gitignore: Ignore generated dtrace probe file
	* daemon/Makefile.am: Build dtrace probe header & object
	  files
	* daemon/libvirtd.stp: SystemTAP convenience probeset
	* daemon/libvirtd.c: Add connect/disconnect & TLS probes
	* daemon/remote.c: Add SASL and PolicyKit auth probes
	* daemon/probes.d: Master probe definition
	* daemon/libvirtd.h: Add convenience macro for probes
	  so that compilation is a no-op when dtrace is not available
	* examples/systemtap/Makefile.am, examples/systemtap/client.stp
	  Example systemtap script using dtrace probe markers
	* libvirt.spec.in: Enable dtrace on F13/RHEL6
	* mingw32-libvirt.spec.in: Force disable dtrace

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add test suite for virSocket APIs
	Add a test suite for check parsing, formatting, range calculation
	and netmask checking APIs in virSocketAddr.

	* tests/sockettest.c, tests/Makefile.am: Add new test case

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Ban use of all inet_* functions
	All the inet_* functions can be replaced with calls to the
	virSocket APIs. Since many of the inet_* funtions are unsafe,
	and the remainder are obsolete, forbid all future use of them
	in libvirt.

	* Makefile.nonreentrant: Ban use of inet_*

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove all use of inet_pton and inet_ntop
	The  inet_pton and inet_ntop functions are obsolete, replaced
	by getaddrinfo+getnameinfo with the AI_NUMERICHOST flag set.
	These can be accessed via the virSocket APIs.

	The bridge.c code had methods for fetching the IP address of
	a bridge which used inet_ntop. Aside from the use of inet_ntop
	these methods are broken, because a NIC can have multiple
	addresses and this only returns one address. Since the methods
	are never used, just remove them.

	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_learnipaddr.c:
	  Replace inet_pton and inet_ntop with virSocket APIs
	* src/util/bridge.c, src/util/bridge.h: Remove unused methods
	  which called inet_ntop.

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove both addrToString methods
	The addrToString functionality is now available via the
	virSocketFormatAddrFull method.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c: Remove
	  addrToString methods

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix error reporting for virSocketParse
	The virSocketParse method was not doing any error reporting
	which meant the true cause of the problem was lost. Remove
	all error reporting from callers, and push it into virSocketParse

	* src/util/network.c: Add error reporting to virSocketParse
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/network_conf.c,
	  src/network/bridge_driver.c: Remove error reporting in
	  callers of virSocketParse

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Expand virSocketFormat to be more flexible
	The getnameinfo() function is more flexible than inet_ntop()
	avoiding the need to if/else the code based on socket family.
	Also make it support UNIX socket addrs and allow inclusion
	of a port (service) address. Finally do proper error reporting
	via normal APIs.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_ebiptables_driver.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Fix error handling with virSocketFormat
	* src/util/network.c: Rewrite virSocketFormat to use getnameinfo
	  and cope with UNIX socket addrs.

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove pointless nwIPAddress struct & void *casts
	The nwIPAddress was simply a wrapper about virSocketAddr.
	Just use the latter directly, removing all the extra field
	de-references from code & helper APIs for parsing/formatting.

	Also remove all the redundant casts from strong types to
	void * and then immediately back to strong types.

	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.h: Remove nwIPAddress
	* src/conf/nwfilter_conf.c, src/nwfilter/nwfilter_ebiptables_driver.c:
	  Update to use virSocketAddr and remove void * casts.

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix netmask checks for IPv6 in virSocketCheckNetmask
	There was a typo in the IPv6 path of virSocketCheckNetmask which
	caused it to never execute.

	* src/util/network.c: s/AF_INET/AF_INET6/ in virSocketCheckNetmask

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix passing of address family to virSocketParseAddr
	The virSocketParseAddr function was accepting any AF_* constant
	and using that to set the ai_flags field in struct addrinfo.
	This is invalid, since address families must go in the ai_family
	field of the struct.

	* src/util/network.c: Fix handling of address family
	* src/conf/network_conf.c, src/network/bridge_driver.c: Pass
	  AF_UNSPEC instead of relying on it being 0.

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Include length with virSocketAddr data
	Some operations on socket addresses need to know the length of
	the sockaddr struct for the particular address family. This
	info was being discarded when passing around virSocketAddr
	instances. Turn it from a union into a struct containing
	union+socklen_t fields, so length is always kept around.

	* src/util/network.h: Add socklen_t field to virSocketAddr
	* src/util/network.c, src/network/bridge_driver.c,
	  src/conf/domain_conf.c: Update to take account of new
	  struct definition.

2010-10-22  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove useless code in error path of getnameinfo()
	If getnameinfo() with NI_NUMERICHOST set fails, there are no
	grounds to expect inet_ntop to succeed, since these calls
	are functionally equivalent. Remove useless inet_ntop code
	in the getnameinfo() error path.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c: Remove
	  calls to inet_ntop

2010-10-21  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	maint: sort private sym lists
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Sort by header name, then within
	header, and drop duplicate virNetworkDefParseNode,
	virFileLinkPointsTo and virXPathBoolean.

2010-10-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Enable JSON and netdev features in QEMU >= 0.13
	The QEMU 0.13 release is finally out and from testing in RHEL-6
	we know that its JSON and netdev features are now good enough
	for us to use by default.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Enable JSON + netdev for QEMU >= 0.13

2010-10-21  Eric Blake  <eblake@redhat.com>

	audit: simplify declaration
	* src/util/virtaudit.c (virAuditSend): one less ifdef, since gcc
	does not care if an ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED var gets used in some paths.

2010-10-21  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	qemu: Exit on first error in qemuDomainGetMemoryParameters
	There is no point in trying to fill params beyond the first error,
	because when qemuDomainGetMemoryParameters returns -1 then the caller
	cannot detect which values in params are valid.

	virsh: Don't read nparams when virDomainGetMemoryParameters fails
	Also exit early when nparams is 0.

	Rename VIR_DOMAIN_SWAP_HARD_LIMIT to VIR_DOMAIN_MEMORY_SWAP_HARD_LIMIT
	To get them under the common VIR_DOMAIN_MEMORY_* prefix.

	Fix formatting of the memtune XML element
	Also output the min_guarantee element when set.

2010-10-20  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Fix make check on RHEL-5
	The test for <vcpu> element is unrelated to vnc so the easiest fix is to
	remove related configuration.

2010-10-20  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Don't let daemon-conf test fail when auditing is disabled

2010-10-20  Nikunj A. Dadhania  <nikunj@linux.vnet.ibm.com>

	Update comments for the memory tunables macros
	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Update comment with actual description

2010-10-20  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Add John Morrissey to AUTHORS

2010-10-20  John Morrissey  <jwm@horde.net>

	Add process= support for 'qemu-kvm -name'
	This sets the process name to the same value as the Windows title,
	but since the name is limited to 16 chars only this is kept as a
	configuration option and turned off by default
	* src/qemu/qemu.conf src/qemu/qemu_conf.[ch]: hceck for support in the
	  QEmu help output, add the option in qemu conf file and augment
	  qemudBuildCommandLine to add it if switched on
	* src/qemu/libvirtd_qemu.aug src/qemu/test_libvirtd_qemu.aug: augment
	  the augeas lenses accordingly
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: cope with the extra flag being detected now

	nwfilter: avoid dir. enforcement for certain types of rules
	 Avoid the enforcement of direction if

	Don't fail lxc domain start when memory controller support is missing
	Debian stock kernel has CONFIG_CGROUP_MEM_RES_CTLR disabled due to the

	Fix compile errors in remote.c and newly added audit code

2010-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix symbol exports & remove duplicated libvirt_util.la linkage
	The libvirt_util.la library was mistakenly linked into libvirtd
	directly. Since libvirt_util.la is already linked to libvirt.so,
	this resulted in libvirtd getting two copies of the code and
	more critically 2 copies of static global variables.

	Testing in turn exposed a issue with loadable modules. The
	gnulib replacement functions are not exported to loadable
	modules. Rather than trying to figure out the name sof all
	gnulib functions & export them, just linkage all loadable
	modules against libgnu.la statically.

	* daemon/Makefile.am: Remove linkage of libvirt_util.la
	  and libvirt_driver.la
	* src/Makefile.am: Link driver modules against libgnu.la
	* src/libvirt.c: Don't try to load modules which were
	  compiled out
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export all other internal
	  symbols that are required  by drivers

	Audit SELinux label assignment.
	A more natural auditing point would perhaps be
	SELinuxSetSecurityProcessLabel, but this happens in the child after root
	permissions are dropped, so the kernel would refuse the audit record.

2010-10-20  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Audit VM start/stop/suspend/resume
	Most operations are audited at the libvirtd level; auditing in
	src/libvirt.c would result in two audit entries per operation (one in
	the client, one in libvirtd).

	The only exception is a domain stopping of its own will (e.g. because
	the user clicks on "shutdown" inside the interface).  There can often be
	no client connected at the time the domain stops, so libvirtd does not
	have any virConnectPtr object on which to attach an event watch.  This
	patch therefore adds auditing directly inside the qemu driver (other
	drivers are not supported).

2010-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Basic framework for auditing integration
	Integrate with libaudit.so for auditing of important operations.
	libvirtd gains a couple of config entries for auditing. By
	default it will enable auditing, if its enabled on the host.
	It can be configured to force exit if auditing is disabled
	on the host. It will can also send audit messages via libvirt
	internal logging API

	Places requiring audit reporting can use the VIR_AUDIT
	macro to report data. This is a no-op unless auditing is
	enabled

	* autobuild.sh, mingw32-libvirt.spec.in: Disable audit
	  on mingw
	* configure.ac: Add check for libaudit
	* daemon/libvirtd.aug, daemon/libvirtd.conf,
	  daemon/test_libvirtd.aug, daemon/libvirtd.c: Add config
	  options to enable auditing
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/util/virterror.c: Add
	  VIR_FROM_AUDIT source
	* libvirt.spec.in: Enable audit
	* src/util/virtaudit.h, src/util/virtaudit.c: Simple internal
	  API for auditing messages

2010-10-20  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix statstest when driver modules are enabled
	The statstest is xen specific. Instead of filling the code with
	a huge number of #ifdef WITH_XEN, just make its entire compilation
	conditional in the Makefile.am. Also ensure it links to the Xen
	driver so that it builds when driver modules are enabled

	* tests/Makefile.am: Make statstest xen conditional. Link to
	  xen driver
	* tests/Makefile.am: Remove all conditionals

	See this link for more details about vcpu_avail for xm usage.
	http://lists.xensource.com/archives/html/xen-devel/2009-11/msg01061.html

	Although this patch adds a distinction between maximum vcpus and

	vcpu: make old API trivially wrap to new API
	Note - this wrapping is completely mechanical; the old API will
	function identically, since the new API validates that the exact
	same flags are provided by the old API.  On a per-driver basis,

	qemu: let qemu group look below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/
	Vdsm needs to communicate with its guest agent via unix domain socket,
	which qemu creates due to the following domain xml device:

	    <channel type='unix'>
	      <target type='virtio' name='com.redhat.rhevm.vdsm'/>
	      <source mode='bind' path='/var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channels/fcp-xp-1.com.redhat.rhevm.vdsm'/>
	    </channel>

	The location of the socket below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/channels makes
	sense, to humans and selinux policy alike. However, that socket should
	be accessible to vdsm, too.

	Due to other (storage) reasons, vdsm is to join the "qemu" group. With
	this patch, vdsm can look below /var/lib/libvirt/qemu and connect to the
	socket.

	The socket itself should be chmod'ed to allow qemu group read/write, but
	that's for another project.

	did previously not cut off existing (ssh) connections but only prevented newly initiated ones. The attached patch allows to cut off existing connections as well, thus enforcing what the filter is showing.

	I had only tested with a configuration where the physical interface is connected to the bridge where the filters are applied. This patch now also solves a filtering problem where the physical interface is not connected to the bridge, but the bridge is given an IP address and the host routes between bridge and physical interface. Here the filters drop non-allowed traffic on the outgoing side on the host.

	nwfilter: resolve deadlock between VM ops and filter update
	 This is from a bug report and conversation on IRC where Soren reported that while a filter update is occurring on one or more VMs (due to a rule having been edited for example), a deadlock can occur when a VM referencing a filter is started.

	The problem is caused by the two locking sequences of

	qemu driver, qemu domain, filter             # for the VM start operation
	filter, qemu_driver, qemu_domain            # for the filter update operation

	that obviously don't lock in the same order. The problem is the 2nd lock sequence. Here the qemu_driver lock is being grabbed in qemu_driver:qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	The following solution is based on the idea of trying to re-arrange the 2nd sequence of locks as follows:

	qemu_driver, filter, qemu_driver, qemu_domain

	and making the qemu driver recursively lockable so that a second lock can occur, this would then lead to the following net-locking sequence

	qemu_driver, filter, qemu_domain

	where the 2nd qemu_driver lock has been ( logically ) eliminated.

	The 2nd part of the idea is that the sequence of locks (filter, qemu_domain) and (qemu_domain, filter) becomes interchangeable if all code paths where filter AND qemu_domain are locked have a preceding qemu_domain lock that basically blocks their concurrent execution

	So, the following code paths exist towards qemu_driver:qemudVMFilterRebuild where we now want to put a qemu_driver lock in front of the filter lock.

	-> nwfilterUndefine()   [ locks the filter ]
	    -> virNWFilterTestUnassignDef()
	        -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	            -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDefine()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	        -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	            -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDriverReload()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolLoadAllConfigs()
	        ->virNWFilterPoolObjLoad()
	            -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	                -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	                    -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	-> nwfilterDriverStartup()
	    -> virNWFilterPoolLoadAllConfigs()
	        ->virNWFilterPoolObjLoad()
	            -> virNWFilterPoolAssignDef() [ locks the filter ]
	                -> virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild()
	                    -> qemudVMFilterRebuild()

	Qemu is not the only driver using the nwfilter driver, but also the UML driver calls into it. Therefore qemuVMFilterRebuild() can be exchanged with umlVMFilterRebuild() along with the driver lock of qemu_driver that can now be a uml_driver. Further, since UML and Qemu domains can be running on the same machine, the triggering of a rebuild of the filter can touch both types of drivers and their domains.

	In the patch below I am now extending each nwfilter callback driver with functions for locking and unlocking the (VM) driver (UML, QEMU) and introduce new functions for locking all registered callback drivers and unlocking them. Then I am distributing the lock-all-cbdrivers/unlock-all-cbdrivers call into the above call paths. The last shown callpath starting with nwfilterDriverStart() is problematic since it is initialize before the Qemu and UML drives are and thus a lock in the path would result in a NULL pointer attempted to be locked -- the call to virNWFilterTriggerVMFilterRebuild() is never called, so we never lock either the qemu_driver or the uml_driver in that path. Therefore, only the first 3 paths now receive calls to lock and unlock all callback drivers. Now that the locks are distributed where it matters I can remove the qemu_driver and uml_driver lock from qemudVMFilterRebuild() and umlVMFilterRebuild() and not requiring the recursive locks.

	For now I want to put this out as an RFC patch. I have tested it by 'stretching' the critical section after the define/undefine functions each lock the filter so I can (easily) concurrently execute another VM operation (suspend,start). That code is in this patch and if you want you can de-activate it. It seems to work ok and operations are being blocked while the update is being done.
	I still also want to verify the other assumption above that locking filter and qemu_domain always has a preceding qemu_driver lock.

	virsh: rework command parsing
	Old virsh command parsing mashes all the args back into a string and
	miss the quotes, this patches fix it. It is also needed for introducing
	qemu-monitor-command which is very useful.

	This patches uses the new vshCommandParser abstraction and adds
	vshCommandArgvParse() for arguments vector, so we don't need
	to mash arguments vector into a command sting.

	And the usage was changed:
	old:
	virsh [options] [commands]

	new:
	virsh [options]... [<command_string>]
	virsh [options]... <command> [args...]

	So we still support commands like:
	"define D.xml; dumpxml D" was parsed as a commands-string.

	and support commands like:
	we will not mash them into a string, we use new argv parser for it.

	But we don't support the command like:
	"define D.xml; dumpxml" was parsed as a command-name, but we have no such command-name.

	virsh: better handling the boolean option
	in old code the following commands are equivalent:
	     virsh # dumpxml --update-cpu=vm1
	     virsh # dumpxml --update-cpu vm1
	because the old code split the option argument into 2 parts:
	--update-cpu=vm1 is split into update-cpu and vm1,
	and update-cpu is a boolean option, so the parser takes vm1 as another
	argument, very strange.

	after this patch applied, the first one will become illegal.

	To achieve this, we don't parse/check options when parsing command sting,
	but check options when parsing a command argument. And the argument is
	not split when parsing command sting.

	xen: Fix virDomain{At,De}tachDevice
	According to API documentation virDomain{At,De}tachDevice calls are
	supposed to only work on active guests for device hotplug. For anything
	beyond that, their *Flags variants have to be used.

	Despite the variant which was acked on libvirt mailing list
	(https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2010-January/msg00385.html)
	commit ed9c14a7ef86d7a45a6d57cbfee5410fca428633 (by Jim Fehlig)
	introduced automagic behavior of these API calls for xen driver. Since
	January, these calls always change persistent configuration of a guest
	and if the guest is currently active, they also hot(un)plug the device.

	That change didn't follow API documentation and also broke device
	hot(un)plug for older xend implementations which do not support changing
	persistent configuration of a guest and hot(un)plugging in one step.

	This patch should not break anything for active guests. On the other
	hand, changing inactive guests is not supported any more.

	    Xend version does not support modifying persistent config

	nwfilter: Instantiate state match in ip(6)tables rules
	In this patch I am extending the rule instantiator to create the state
	match according to the state attribute in the XML. Only one iptables
	rule in the incoming or outgoing direction will be created for a rule
	in direction 'in' or 'out' respectively. A rule in direction 'inout' does
	get iptables rules in both directions.

	implement usb and pci hot attach in AppArmor driver
	Description: Implement AppArmorSetSecurityHostdevLabel() and
	AppArmorRestoreSecurityHostdevLabel() for hostdev and pcidev attach.

	virt-aa-helper also has to be adjusted because *FileIterate() is used for pci
	and usb devices and the corresponding XML for hot attached hostdev and pcidev
	is not in the XML passed to virt-aa-helper. The new '-F filename' option is
	added to append a rule to the profile as opposed to the existing '-f
	filename', which rewrites the libvirt-<uuid>.files file anew. This new '-F'
	option will append a rule to an existing libvirt-<uuid>.files if it exists,
	otherwise it acts the same as '-f'.

	load_profile() and reload_profile() have been adjusted to add an 'append'
	argument, which when true will use '-F' instead of '-f' when executing
	virt-aa-helper.

	All existing calls to load_profile() and reload_profile() have been adjusted
	to use the old behavior (ie append==false) except AppArmorSetSavedStateLabel()
	where it made sense to use the new behavior.

	This patch also adds tests for '-F'.

	Since commands are written in the format

	cmd='iptables ...-m comment --comment \"\" '

	certain characters ('`) in the comment need to be escaped to
	prevent comments from becoming commands themselves or cause other

	- displays 'checking' messages for macvtap and virtualport support and results

	PASS: qemuargv2xmltest

	It's not a real failure (which is why the test was completing

	of the qemu namespace has the potential for undefined effects that
	leaked through the default logging behavior.  After this patch series,
	all tests can access any logged data, and this particular test can
	explicitly check for the presence or absence of the warning, such that
	the test output becomes:

	buf: Fix possible infinite loop in EscapeString, VSnprintf
	The current code will go into an infinite loop if the printf generated
	string is >= 1000, AND exactly 1 character smaller than the amount of free
	space in the buffer. When this happens, we are dropped into the loop body,
	but nothing will actually change, because count == (buf->size - buf->use - 1),
	and virBufferGrow returns unchanged if count < (buf->size - buf->use)

	Fix this by removing the '- 1' bit from 'size'. The *nprintf functions handle
	the NULL byte for us anyways, so we shouldn't need to manually accommodate
	for it.

	Here's a bug where we are actually hitting this issue:

2010-09-03  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	esx: Rework datastore path parsing and handling
	Instead of splitting the path part of a datastore path into
	directory and file name, keep this in one piece. An example:

	  "[datastore] directory/file"

	was split into this before:

	  datastoreName = "datastore"
	  directoryName = "directory"
	  fileName = "file"

	Now it's split into this:

	  datastoreName = "datastore"
	  directoryName = "directory"
	  directoryAndFileName = "directory/file"

	This simplifies code using esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath, because
	directoryAndFileName is used more often than fileName. Also the
	old approach expected the datastore path to reference an actual
	file, but this isn't always correct, especially when listing
	volumes. In that case esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath is used to parse
	a path that references a directory. This fails for a vpx://
	connection because the vCenter returns directory paths with a
	trailing '/'. The new approach is robust against this and the
	actual decision if the datastore path should reference a file or
	a directory is up to the caller of esxUtil_ParseDatastorePath.

	Update the tests accordingly.

	Explicitly pass uml_dir argument to user-mode-linux
	uml_dir overrides user-mode-linux's default of ~/.uml. This is needed
	for a couple of different reasons:

	libvirt expects this to default to virGetUserDirectory(geteuid()) +
	'/.uml'. However, user-mode-linux actually uses the HOME environment
	variable to determine where to look for the uml sockets, but if running
	libvirtd under sudo (which I routinely do during development), $HOME is
	pointing at my user's homedir, while my euid is 0, so libvirt looks in
	/root.

	Also (and this was my actual motivation for this patch), if HOME isn't
	set at all, user-mode-linux utterly fails. Looking at the code, it seems
	it's meant to emit a warning, but alas, it doesn't for some reason.
	If running libvirtd from upstart, HOME is not set, so any system using
	upstart will need this change.

	The most common cause of errors with rhel5-api turn on was missing
	"(type ioemu)" in sexpr or its equivalent in XM configuration file. This

	nwfilter: extend nwfilter reload support
	In this patch I am extending and fixing the nwfilter module's reload support to stop all ongoing threads (for learning IP addresses of interfaces) and rebuild the filtering rules of all interfaces of all VMs when libvirt is started. Now libvirtd rebuilds the filters upon the SIGHUP signal and libvirtd restart.

	About the patch: The nwfilter functions require a virConnectPtr. Therefore I am opening a connection in qemudStartup, which later on needs to be closed outside where the driver lock is held since otherwise it ends up in a deadlock due to virConnectClose() trying to lock the driver as well.

	I have tested this now for a while with several machines running and needing the IP address learner thread(s). The rebuilding of the firewall rules seems to work fine following libvirtd restart or a SIGHUP. Also the termination of libvirtd worked fine.

	Make umlConnectTapDevice ask brAddTap for a persistent tap device.
	This patch does two things:

	 * It makes umlConnectTapDevice ask brAddTap for a persistent tap by
	   passing it a NULL tapfd argument.
	 * Stops umlConnectTapDevice from immediately dismantling the bridge
	   it just set up.

2010-08-15  Soren Hansen  <soren@linux2go.dk>

	Close fd's of persistent tap devices
	When passing a NULL tapfd argument to brAddTap, we need to close the fd
	of the tap device. If we don't, libvirt will keep the fd open
	indefinitely and renders the the guest unable to configure its side of
	the tap device.

	Make sure all command line arguments get passed to UML
	If umlBuildCommandLineChr fails (e.g. due to an unsupported chardev
	type), it returns NULL. umlBuildCommandLine does not check for this and
	sets this as an argument on the comand line, effectively ending the
	argument list. This patch checks for this case and sets the chardev to
	"none".

	nwfilter: Discard class D,E IP addresses when sniffing pkts

	nwfilter: serialize execution of scripts with ebtables cmds
	While testing the SIGHUP handling and reloading of the nwfilter driver, I found that when the filters are rebuilt and mutlipe threads handled the individual interfaces, concurrently running multiple external bash scripts causes strange failures even though the executed ebtables commands are working on different tables for different interfaces. I cannot say for sure where the concurrency problems are caused, but introducing this lock definitely helps.

	bridge: Add --dhcp-no-override option to dnsmasq
	--dhcp-no-override description from dnsmasq man page:

	      Disable  re-use  of  the  DHCP servername and filename fields as
	      extra option space. If it can, dnsmasq moves the boot server and
	      filename  information  (from  dhcp-boot)  out of their dedicated
	      fields into DHCP options. This make extra space available in the
	      DHCP  packet  for options but can, rarely, confuse old or broken
	      clients. This flag forces "simple and safe" behaviour  to  avoid
	      problems in such a case.

	It seems some virtual network card ROMs are this old/buggy so let's add
	--dhcp-no-override as a workaround for them. We don't use extra DHCP
	options so this should be safe. The option was added in dnsmasq-2.41,
	which becomes the minimum required version.

	qemu: Hack around asynchronous device_del
	device_del command is not synchronous for PCI devices, it merely asks
	the guest to release the device and returns. If the host wants to use
	that device before the guest actually releases it, we are in big
	trouble. To avoid this, we already added a loop which waits up to 10
	seconds until the device is actually released before we do anything else
	with that device. But we only added this loop for managed PCI devices
	before we try reattach them back to the host.

	However, we need to wait even for non-managed devices. We don't reattach
	them automatically, but we still want to prevent the host from using it.
	This was revealed thanks to sVirt: when we relabel sysfs files
	corresponding to the PCI device before the guest finished releasing the
	device, qemu is no longer allowed to access those files and if it wants
	(as a result of guest's request) to write anything to them, it just
	exits, which kills the guest.

	This is not a proper fix and needs some further work both on libvirt and
	qemu side in the future.

	length buffer, and therefore the potential to overflow.

	This change also provided the oppurtunity to eliminate the character

	past the end of the number, then simply skip the \n to get to the

	qemu: Fix PCI address allocation
	Patch version revamped by Eric Blake <eblake@redhat.com> of Jiri
	Denemark <jdenemar@redhat.com> original patch

	When attaching a PCI device which doesn't explicitly set its PCI
	address, libvirt allocates the address automatically. The problem is
	that when checking which PCI address is unused, we only check for those
	with slot number higher than the highest slot number ever used.

	Thus attaching/detaching such device several times in a row (31 is the
	theoretical limit, less then 30 tries are enough in practise) makes any
	further device attachment fail. Furthermore, attaching a device with
	predefined PCI address to 0:0:31 immediately forbids attachment of any
	PCI device without explicit address.

	This patch changes the logic so that we always check all PCI addresses
	before we say there is no PCI address available.

	Modifications from v1: revert back to remembering the last slot
	reserved, but allow wraparound to not be limited by the end.
	In this way, slots are still assigned in the same order as
	before the patch, rather than filling in the gaps closest to
	0 and risking making windows guests mad.

	Add iptables rule to fixup DHCP response checksum.
	This patch attempts to take advantage of a newly added netfilter
	module to correct for a problem with some guest DHCP client
	implementations when used in conjunction with a DHCP server run on the
	host systems with packet checksum offloading enabled.

	The problem is that, when the guest uses a RAW socket to read the DHCP
	response packets, the checksum hasn't yet been fixed by the IP stack,
	so it is incorrect.

	The fix implemented here is to add a rule to the POSTROUTING chain of
	the mangle table in iptables that fixes up the checksum for packets on
	the virtual network's bridge that are destined for the bootpc port (ie
	"dhcpc", ie port 68) port on the guest.

	Only very new versions of iptables will have this support (it will be
	in the next upstream release), so a failure to add this rule only
	results in a warning message. The iptables patch is here:

	  http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/58525/

	A corresponding kernel module patch is also required (the backend of
	the iptables patch) and that will be in the next release of the
	kernel.

	Fix the ACS checking in the PCI code.
	When trying to assign a PCI device to a guest, we have
	to check that all bridges upstream of that device support
	ACS.  That means that we have to find the parent bridge of
	the current device, check for ACS, then find the parent bridge
	of that device, check for ACS, etc.  As it currently stands,
	the code to do this iterates through all PCI devices on the
	system, looking for a device that has a range of busses that
	included the current device's bus.

	That check is not restrictive enough, though.  Depending on
	how we iterated through the list of PCI devices, we could first
	find the *topmost* bridge in the system; since it necessarily had
	a range of busses including the current device's bus, we
	would only ever check the topmost bridge, and not check
	any of the intermediate bridges.

	Note that this also caused a fairly serious bug in the
	secondary bus reset code, where we could erroneously
	find and reset the topmost bus instead of the inner bus.

	This patch changes pciGetParentDevice() so that it first
	checks if a bridge device's secondary bus exactly matches
	the bus of the device we are looking for.  If it does, we've
	found the correct parent bridge and we are done.  If it does not,
	then we check to see if this bridge device's busses *include* the
	bus of the device we care about.  If so, we mark this bridge device
	as best, and go on.  If we later find another bridge device whose
	busses include this device, but is more restrictive, then we
	free up the previous best and mark the new one as best.  This
	algorithm ensures that in the normal case we find the direct
	parent, but in the case that the parent bridge secondary bus
	is not exactly the same as the device, we still find the
	correct bridge.

	This patch was tested by me on a 4-port NIC with a
	bridge without ACS (where assignment failed), a 4-port
	NIC with a bridge with ACS (where assignment succeeded),
	and a 2-port NIC with no bridges (where assignment
	succeeded).

	esx: Improve blocked task detection and fix race condition
	esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion can take a UUID to lookup the
	corresponding domain and check if the current task for it
	is blocked by a question. It calls another function to do
	this: esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion looks up
	the VirtualMachine and checks for a question. If there is
	a question it calls esxVI_HandleVirtualMachineQuestion to
	handle it.

	If there was no question or it has been answered the call
	to esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion returns 0.
	If any error occurred during the lookup and answering
	process -1 is returned. The problem with this is, that -1
	is also returned when there was no error but the question
	could not be answered. So esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion cannot
	distinguish between this two situations and reports that a
	question is blocking the task even when there was actually
	another problem.

	This inherent problem didn't surface until vSphere 4.1 when
	you try to define a new domain. The driver tries to lookup
	the domain that is just in the process of being registered.
	There seems to be some kind of race condition and the driver
	manages to issue a lookup command before the ESX server was
	able to register the domain. This used to work before.

	Due to the return value problem described above the driver
	reported a false error message in that case.

	To solve this esxVI_WaitForTaskCompletion now takes an
	additional occurrence parameter that describes whether or
	not to expect the domain to be existent. Also add a new
	parameter to esxVI_LookupAndHandleVirtualMachineQuestion
	that allows to distinguish if the call returned -1 because
	of an actual error or because the question could not be
	answered.

	libcurl allows to disable the type-checking code that triggers those

	pciResetDevice: use inactive devices to determine safe reset

2010-07-24  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Add tests for the new Qemu namespace XML.
	Thanks to DV for knocking together the Relax-NG changes
	quickly for me.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Change the domain.rng to correspond to the new schema
	 - Don't allocate caps->ns in testQemuCapsInit since it is a static table

	Changes since v2:
	 - Change domain.rng to add restrictions on allowed environment names

	Changes since v3:
	 - Remove a bogus comment in the tests

2010-07-24  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Qemu remote protocol.
	Since we are adding a new "per-hypervisor" protocol, we
	make it so that the qemu remote protocol uses a new
	PROTOCOL and PROGRAM number.  This allows us to easily
	distinguish it from the normal REMOTE protocol.

	This necessitates changing the proc in remote_message_header
	from a "remote_procedure" to an "unsigned", which should
	be the same size (and thus preserve the on-wire protocol).

	Changes since v1:
	 - Fixed up a couple of script problems in remote_generate_stubs.pl
	 - Switch an int flag to a bool in dispatch.c

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - Change unsigned proc to signed proc, to conform to spec

	Qemu arbitrary monitor commands.
	Implement the qemu driver's virDomainQemuMonitorCommand
	and hook it into the API entry point.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Rename the (external) qemuMonitorCommand to qemuDomainMonitorCommand
	 - Add virCheckFlags to qemuDomainMonitorCommand

	Changes since v2:
	 - Drop ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED from the flags

	Changes since v3:
	 - Add a flag to priv so we only print out monitor command warning once.  Note
	   that this has not been plumbed into qemuDomainObjPrivateXMLFormat or
	   qemuDomainObjPrivateXMLParse, which means that if you run a monitor command,
	   restart libvirtd, and then run another monitor command, you may get an
	   an erroneous VIR_INFO.  It's a pretty minor matter, and I didn't think it
	   warranted the additional code.
	 - Add BeginJob/EndJob calls around EnterMonitor/ExitMonitor

2010-07-24  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Qemu Monitor API entry point.
	Add the library entry point for the new virDomainQemuMonitorCommand()
	entry point.  Because this is not part of the "normal" libvirt API,
	it gets its own header file, library file, and will eventually
	get its own over-the-wire protocol later in the series.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Go back to using the virDriver table for qemuDomainMonitorCommand, due to
	   linking issues
	 - Added versioning information to the libvirt-qemu.so

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - Add LGPL header to libvirt-qemu.c
	 - Make virLibConnError and virLibDomainError macros instead of function calls

	Changes since v4:
	 - Move exported symbols to libvirt_qemu.syms

	Now that we have the ability to specify arbitrary qemu

	Changes since v1:
	 - Rename num_extra to num_args
	 - Fix up a memory leak on an error path

	Changes since v2:

	Qemu arbitrary command-line arguments.
	Implement the qemu hooks for XML namespace data.  This

	specify:

	<qemu:commandline>
	 <qemu:arg value='arg'/>
	 <qemu:env name='name' value='value'/>
	</qemu:commandline>

	In the domain XML.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Change the <qemu:arg>arg</qemu:arg> XML to <qemu:arg value='arg'/> XML
	 - Fix up some memory leaks in qemuDomainDefNamespaceParse
	 - Rename num_extra and extra to num_args and args, respectively
	 - Fixed up some error messages
	 - Make sure to escape user-provided data in qemuDomainDefNamespaceFormatXML

	Changes since v2:
	 - Add checking to ensure environment variable names are valid
	 - Invert the logic in qemuDomainDefNamespaceFormatXML to return early

	Changes since v3:
	 - Change strspn() to c_isalpha() check of first letter of environment variable

	Add namespace callback hooks to domain_conf.
	This patch adds namespace XML parsers to be hooked into
	the main domain parser.  This allows for individual hypervisor
	drivers to add per-namespace XML into the main domain XML.

	Changes since v1:
	 - Use a statically declared table for caps->ns, removing the need to
	   allocate/free it.

	Changes since v2:
	 - None

	Changes since v3:
	 - None

	Fix SEGV on exit after domainEventDeregister()
	When the last callback is removed using domainEventDeregister(), the
	events dispatcher is deregistered from the C-library, but
	domainEventsCallbacks is still an empty list.
	On shutdown __del__() deregisters the dispatacher again, which SEGVs

		# You need the event-loop implementation from the Python examples;
		# give the file a name which is importable by Python.
		ln examples/domain-events/events-python/event-test.py eloop.py
		python -c 'from eloop import *

		virEventLoopPureStart()
		c = libvirt.open("xen:///")
		c.domainEventRegister(dump, None)
		c.domainEventDeregister(dump)
		sys.exit(0)'

	domainEventDeregister() needs to delete domainEventCallbacks so subsequent
	calls to __del__() and domainEventRegister() choose the right code paths.
	Setting it to None is not enough, since calling domainEventRegiser() again
	would trigger an TypeError.

	pciSharesBusWithActive fails to find multiple devices on bus
	The first conditional is always true which means the iterator will
	never find another device on the same bus.

	    if (dev->domain != check->domain ||
	        dev->bus != check->bus ||
	  ----> (check->slot == check->slot &&

	The goal of that check is to verify that the device is either:

	  in a different pci domain
	  on a different bus
	  is the same identical device

	This means libvirt may issue a secondary bus reset when there are

	Set a stable & high MAC addr for guest TAP devices on host
	A Linux software bridge will assume the MAC address of the enslaved
	interface with the numerically lowest MAC addr. When the bridge
	changes MAC address there is a period of network blackout, so a
	change should be avoided. The kernel gives TAP devices a completely
	random MAC address. Occassionally the random TAP device MAC is lower
	than that of the physical interface (eth0, eth1etc) that is enslaved,
	causing the bridge to change its MAC.

	This change sets an explicit MAC address for all TAP devices created
	using the configured MAC from the XML, but with the high byte set
	to 0xFE. This should ensure TAP device MACs are higher than any
	physical interface MAC.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/uml/uml_conf.c: Pass in a MAC addr
	  for the TAP device with high byte set to 0xFE

	Remove erroneous setting of return value to errno.
	One error exit in virStorageBackendCreateBlockFrom was setting the
	return value to errno. The convention for volume build functions is to
	return 0 on success or -1 on failure. Not only was it not necessary to
	set the return value (it defaults to -1, and is set to 0 when
	everything has been successfully completed), in the case that some
	caller were checking for < 0 rather than != 0, they would incorrectly
	believe that it completed successfully.

	Change virDirCreate to return -errno on failure.
	virDirCreate also previously returned 0 on success and errno on
	failure. This makes it fit the recommended convention of returning 0
	on success, -errno (ie a negative number) on failure.

	Make virStorageBackendCopyToFD return -errno.
	Previously virStorageBackendCopyToFD would simply return -1 on
	error. This made the error return from one of its callers inconsistent
	(createRawFileOpHook is supposed to return -errno, but if
	virStorageBackendCopyToFD failed, createRawFileOpHook would just
	return -1). Since there is a useful errno in every case of error
	return from virStorageBackendCopyToFD, and since the other uses of
	that function ignore the return code (beyond simply checking to see if
	it is < 0), this is a safe change.

2010-07-22  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Change virFileOperation to return -errno (ie < 0) on error.
	virFileOperation previously returned 0 on success, or the value of
	errno on failure. Although there are other functions in libvirt that
	use this convention, the preferred (and more common) convention is to
	return 0 on success and -errno (or simply -1 in some cases) on
	failure. This way the check for failure is always (ret < 0).

	* src/util/util.c - change virFileOperation and virFileOperationNoFork to
	                    return -errno on failure.

	* src/storage/storage_backend.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c
	  - change the hook functions passed to virFileOperation to return
	    -errno on failure.

	Rearrange VGA/IDE controller address reservation
	The first VGA and IDE devices need to have fixed PCI address
	reservations. Currently this is handled inline with the other
	non-primary VGA/IDE devices. The fixed virtio balloon device
	at slot 3, ensures auto-assignment skips the slots 1/2. The
	virtio address will shortly become configurable though. This
	means the reservation of fixed slots needs to be done upfront
	to ensure that they don't get re-used for other devices.

	This is more or less reverting the previous changeset:

	  Fix restore of QEMU guests with PCI device reservation

	The difference is that this time, instead of unconditionally

	ensures restore step doesn't have problems

	Fix a deadlock in bi-directional p2p concurrent migration.
	If you try to execute two concurrent migrations p2p
	from A->B and B->A, the two libvirtd's will deadlock
	trying to perform the migrations.  The reason for this is
	that in p2p migration, the libvirtd's are responsible for
	making the RPC Prepare, Migrate, and Finish calls.  However,
	they are currently holding the driver lock while doing so,
	which basically guarantees deadlock in this scenario.

	This patch fixes the situation by adding
	qemuDomainObjEnterRemoteWithDriver and
	qemuDomainObjExitRemoteWithDriver helper methods.  The Enter
	take an additional object reference, then drops both the
	domain object lock and the driver lock.  The Exit takes
	both the driver and domain object lock, then drops the
	reference.  Adding calls to these Enter and Exit helpers
	around remote calls in the various migration methods
	seems to fix the problem for me in testing.

	This should make the situation safe. The additional domain
	object reference ensures that the domain object won't disappear
	while this operation is happening.  The BeginJob that is called
	inside of qemudDomainMigratePerform ensures that we can't execute a
	second migrate (or shutdown, or save, etc) job while the
	migration is active.  Finally, the additional check on the state
	of the vm after we reacquire the locks ensures that we can't
	be surprised by an external event (domain crash, etc).

	Make virsh setmaxmem balloon only when successful.
	After playing around with virsh setmaxmem for a bit,
	I ran into some surprising behavior; if a hypervisor does
	not support the virDomainSetMaxMemory() API, but the value
	specified for setmaxmem is less than the current amount
	of memory in the domain, the domain would be ballooned
	down *before* an error was reported.

	To make this more consistent, run virDomainSetMaxMemory()
	before trying to shrink; that way, if an error is thrown,
	no changes to the running domain are made.

	fsync new storage volumes even if new volume was copied.
	Originally the storage volume files were opened with O_DSYNC to make
	sure they were flushed to disk immediately. It turned out that this
	was extremely slow in some cases, so the O_DSYNC was removed in favor
	of just calling fsync() after all the data had been written. However,
	this call to fsync was inside the block that is executed to zero-fill
	the end of the volume file. In cases where the new volume is copied
	from an old volume, and they are the same length, this fsync would
	never take place.

	Now the fsync is *always* done, unless there is an error (in which
	case it isn't important, and is most likely inappropriate.

	Don't skip zero'ing end of volume file when inputvol is shorter than newvol
	A missing set of braces around an error condition caused us to skip

	the case of error, but was always being taken).

	Fix up inconsistent virsh option error reporting.
	The virsh option error reporting was not being used
	consistently; some commands would spit out errors on
	missing required options while others would just silently fail.
	However, vshCommandOptString knows which ones are required
	and which ones aren't, so make it spit out an error where

	Use the extract backing store format in storage volume lookup
	The storage volume lookup code was probing for the backing store

	Rewrite qemu-img backing store format handling
	When creating qcow2 files with a backing store, it is important
	to set an explicit format to prevent QEMU probing. The storage
	backend was only doing this if it found a 'kvm-img' binary. This
	is wrong because plenty of kvm-img binaries don't support an
	explicit format, and plenty of 'qemu-img' binaries do support
	a format. The result was that most qcow2 files were not getting
	a backing store format.

	argument formats

	Disk format probing is now disabled by default. A new config
	option in /etc/qemu/qemu.conf will re-enable it for existing
	deployments where this causes trouble

	Pass security driver object into all security driver callbacks
	The implementation of security driver callbacks often needs
	to access the security driver object. Currently only a handful
	of callbacks include the driver object as a parameter. Later
	patches require this is many more places.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pass in the security driver object
	  to all callbacks
	* src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c, src/qemu/qemu_security_stacked.c,
	  src/security/security_apparmor.c, src/security/security_driver.h,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c: Add a virSecurityDriverPtr
	  param to all security callbacks

	Convert all disk backing store loops to shared helper API
	Update the QEMU cgroups code, QEMU DAC security driver, SELinux
	and AppArmour security drivers over to use the shared helper API

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/virt-aa-helper.c:
	  Convert over to use virDomainDiskDefForeachPath()

	Add an API for iterating over disk paths
	There is duplicated code which iterates over disk backing stores
	performing some action. Provide a convenient helper for doing
	this to eliminate duplication & risk of mistakes with disk format
	probing

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDiskDefForeachPath()

	Require format to be passed into virStorageFileGetMetadata
	Require the disk image to be passed into virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	If this is set to VIR_STORAGE_FILE_AUTO, then the format will be
	resolved using probing. This makes it easier to control when
	probing will be used

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c,
	  src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/virt-aa-helper.c:
	  Set VIR_STORAGE_FILE_AUTO when calling virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c: Probe for disk format before
	  calling virStorageFileGetMetadata.
	* src/util/storage_file.h, src/util/storage_file.c: Remove format
	  from virStorageFileMeta struct & require it to be passed into
	  method.

2010-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor virStorageFileGetMetadataFromFD to separate functionality
	The virStorageFileGetMetadataFromFD did two jobs in one. First
	it probed for storage type, then it extracted metadata for the
	type. It is desirable to be able to separate these jobs, allowing
	probing without querying metadata, and querying metadata without
	probing.

	To prepare for this, split out probing code into a new pair of
	methods

	  virStorageFileProbeFormatFromFD
	  virStorageFileProbeFormat

	* src/util/storage_file.c, src/util/storage_file.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Introduce virStorageFileProbeFormat
	  and virStorageFileProbeFormatFromFD

2010-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove 'type' field from FileTypeInfo struct
	Instead of including a field in FileTypeInfo struct for the
	disk format, rely on the array index matching the format.
	Use verify() to assert the correct number of elements in the
	array.

	* src/util/storage_file.c: remove type field from FileTypeInfo

2010-07-19  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Extract the backing store format as well as name, if available
	When QEMU opens a backing store for a QCow2 file, it will
	normally auto-probe for the format of the backing store,
	rather than assuming it has the same format as the referencing
	file. There is a QCow2 extension that allows an explicit format
	for the backing store to be embedded in the referencing file.
	This closes the auto-probing security hole in QEMU.

	This backing store format can be useful for libvirt users
	of virStorageFileGetMetadata, so extract this data and report
	it.

	QEMU does not require disk image backing store files to be in
	the same format the file linkee. It will auto-probe the disk
	format for the backing store when opening it. If the backing
	store was intended to be a raw file this could be a security
	hole, because a guest may have written data into its disk that
	then makes the backing store look like a qcow2 file. If it can
	trick QEMU into thinking the raw file is a qcow2 file, it can
	access arbitrary files on the host by adding further backing
	store links.

	To address this, callers of virStorageFileGetMeta need to be
	told of the backing store format. If no format is declared,
	they can make a decision whether to allow format probing or
	not.

	CVE-2010-2242 Apply a source port mapping to virtual network masquerading
	IPtables will seek to preserve the source port unchanged when
	doing masquerading, if possible. NFS has a pseudo-security
	option where it checks for the source port <= 1023 before
	allowing a mount request. If an admin has used this to make the
	host OS trusted for mounts, the default iptables behaviour will
	potentially allow NAT'd guests access too. This needs to be
	stopped.

	With this change, the iptables -t nat -L -n -v rules for the
	default network will be

	man pages: update authors and copyright notice for libvirtd and virsh
	This patch removes the individual author names from the libvirtd and virsh
	man pages, instead referring to the main AUTHORS file distributed with
	libvirt.  This approach is needed, as we can't guarantee unicode support
	across all versions of pod2man used with libvirt.

	Additionally, this patch includes the libvirtd man page in the spec file
	used with "make rpm".  Without this patch "make rpm" is broken.

	RFC: Canonicalize block device paths
	There are many naming conventions for partitions associated with a
	block device.  Some of the major ones are:

	/dev/foo -> /dev/foo1
	/dev/foo1 -> /dev/foo1p1
	/dev/mapper/foo -> /dev/mapper/foop1
	/dev/disk/by-path/foo -> /dev/disk/by-path/foo-part1

	The universe of possible conventions isn't clear.  Rather than trying
	to understand all possible conventions, this patch divides devices
	into two groups, device mapper devices and everything else.  Device
	mapper devices seem always to follow the convention of device ->
	devicep1; everything else is canonicalized.

	daemon: dispatch.c should include stdio.h (and stdarg.h)
	dispatch.c requires stdio.h (and stdarg.h), however, currently
	dispatch.c implicitly relys on rpc/xdr.h to include stdio.h.
	If rpc/xdr.h unxpectedly does not include stdio.h, the compilation
	of dispatch.c fails.

	This can happen, for example, when portablexdr is installed
	under /usr/local; because portablexdr's rpc/xdr.h does not
	include stdio.h and gcc looks up it not /usr/include/rpc/xdr.h.

	Note that stdarg.h is also included according to man va_start,
	although stdio.h seems including it anyway.

	cpuCompare: Fix crash on unexpected CPU XML
	When comparing a CPU without <model> element, such as

	    <cpu>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='1' threads='1'/>

	libvirt would happily crash without warning.

2010-07-13  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	cpu: Fail when CPU type cannot be detected from XML
	When autodetecting whether XML describes guest or host CPU, the presence
	of <arch> element is checked. If it's present, we treat the XML as host
	CPU definition. Which is right, since guest CPU definitions do not
	contain <arch> element. However, if at the same time the root <cpu>
	element contains `match' attribute, we would silently ignore it and
	still treat the XML as host CPU. We should rather refuse such invalid
	XML.

	cpuCompare: Fix comparison of two host CPUs
	When a CPU to be compared with host CPU describes a host CPU instead of
	a guest CPU, the result is incorrect. This is because instead of
	treating additional features in host CPU description as required, they
	were treated as if they were mentioned with all possible policies at the
	same time.

	qemu: Use -nodefconfig when probing for CPU models
	In case qemu supports -nodefconfig, libvirt adds uses it when launching
	new guests. Since this option may affect CPU models supported by qemu,
	we need to use it when probing for available models.

	virsh: tweak help output for VSH_OT_DATA
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=609044 complained
	that 'virsh help pool-create-as' didn't document the shortcut
	that you can do 'virsh pool-create-as $name $type --target $target'
	rather than having to supply the four optional source- arguments
	in order to fill out the necessary positional arguments.

	This one-liner changes the help output to hopefully make this more obvious:

	Avoid invoking the qemu monitor destroy callback if the constructor fails
	Some, but not all, codepaths in the qemuMonitorOpen() method
	would trigger the destroy callback. The caller does not expect
	this to be invoked if construction fails, only during normal

	Fix crash when detaching devices from qemu domains.

	Check for active PCI devices when doing nodedevice operations.
	In the current libvirt PCI code, there is no checking whether
	a PCI device is in use by a guest when doing node device
	detach or reattach.  This causes problems when a device is
	assigned to a guest, and the administrator starts issuing
	nodedevice commands.  Make it so that we check the list
	of active devices when trying to detach/reattach, and only
	allow the operation if the device is not assigned to a guest.

	lxc: Fix virsh console doesn't work after restarting libvirtd
	Because tty path is unexpectedly not saved in the live configuration
	file of a domain, libvirtd cannot get the console of the domain back
	after restarting.

	The reason why the tty path isn't saved is that, to save the tty path,
	the save function, virDomainSaveConfig, requires that the target domain
	is running (pid != -1), however, lxc driver calls the function before
	starting the domain to pass the configuration to controller.

	To ensure to save the tty path, the patch lets lxc driver call the save
	function again after starting the domain.

	Fix a reference leak for node devices.
	There were some major, and some minor bugs having to do with
	the reference counting of node devices in daemon/remote.c.

	Some functions were completely failing to unreference node devices;
	this would lead to many open file descriptors, which would eventually
	fail.

	The minor bugs were along the same lines, but were in rarely
	used error paths.

	Don't squash file permissions when migration fails
	If an active migration operation fails, or is cancelled by the

	Fix migration in text mode and shared storage migration in json mode
	The patches for shared storage migration were not correctly written
	for json mode. Thus the 'blk' and 'inc' parameters were never being
	set. In addition they didn't set the QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_BACKGROUND
	so migration was synchronous. Due to multiple bugs in QEMU's JSON
	impl this wasn't noticed because it treated the sync migration requst
	as asynchronous anyway. Finally 'background' parameter was converted
	to take arbitrary flags but not renamed, and not all uses were changed
	to unsigned int.

	Avoid blocking all APIs during incoming migration
	During incoming migration the QEMU monitor is not able to be
	used. The incoming migration code did not keep hold of the
	job lock because migration is split across multiple API calls.
	This meant that further monitor commands on the guest would
	hang until migration finished with no timeout.

	In this change the qemuDomainMigratePrepare method sets the
	job flag just before it returns. The qemuDomainMigrateFinish
	method checks for this job flag & clears it once done. This
	prevents any use of the monitor between prepare+finish steps.

	The qemuDomainGetJobInfo method is also updated to refresh
	the job elapsed time. This means that virsh domjobinfo can
	return time data during incoming migration

	Set labelling for character devices in security drivers
	When configuring serial, parallel, console or channel devices
	with a file, dev or pipe backend type, it is necessary to label
	the file path in the security drivers. For char devices of type
	file, it is neccessary to pre-create (touch) the file if it does

	cgroup: Enable memory.use_hierarchy of cgroup for domain
	Through conversation with Kumar L Srikanth-B22348, I found
	that the function of getting memory usage (e.g., virsh dominfo)
	doesn't work for lxc with ns subsystem of cgroup enabled.

	This is because of features of ns and memory subsystems.
	Ns creates child cgroup on every process fork and as a result
	processes in a container are not assigned in a cgroup for
	domain (e.g., libvirt/lxc/test1/). For example, libvirt_lxc
	and init (or somewhat specified in XML) are assigned into
	libvirt/lxc/test1/8839/ and libvirt/lxc/test1/8839/8849/,
	respectively. On the other hand, memory subsystem accounts
	memory usage within a group of processes by default, i.e.,
	it does not take any child (and descendant) groups into
	account. With the two features, virsh dominfo which just
	checks memory usage of a cgroup for domain always returns
	zero because the cgroup has no process.

	Setting memory.use_hierarchy of a group allows to account
	(and limit) memory usage of every descendant groups of the group.
	By setting it of a cgroup for domain, we can get proper memory
	usage of lxc with ns subsystem enabled. (To be exact, the
	setting is required only when memory and ns subsystems are
	enabled at the same time, e.g., mount -t cgroup none /cgroup.)

2010-06-24  Ryota Ozaki  <ozaki.ryota@gmail.com>

	cgroup: Change virCgroupRemove to remove all descendant groups at first
	As same as normal directories, a cgroup cannot be removed if it
	contains sub groups. This patch changes virCgroupRemove to remove
	all descendant groups (subdirectories) of a target group before
	removing the target group.

	The handling is required when we run lxc with ns subsystem of cgroup.
	Ns subsystem automatically creates child cgroups on every process
	forks, but unfortunately the groups are not removed on process exits,
	so we have to remove them by ourselves.

	With this patch, such child (and descendant) groups are surely removed
	at lxc shutdown, i.e., lxcVmCleanup which calls virCgroupRemove.

	Add '-nodefconfig' command line arg to QEMU
	We already use the '-nodefaults' command line arg with QEMU to stop
	it adding any default devices to guests. Unfortunately, QEMU will
	load global config files from /etc/qemu that may also add default
	devices. These aren't blocked by '-nodefaults', so we need to also
	add the '-nodefconfig' arg to prevent that.

	Unfortunately these global config files are also used to define
	custom CPU models. So in blocking global hardware device addition
	we also block definitions of new CPU models. Libvirt doesn't know
	about these custom CPU models though, so it would never make use
	of them anyway. Thus blocking them via -nodefconfig isn't a show
	stopping problem. We would need to expand libvirt's own CPU model
	XML database to support these instead.

	Fix reference handling leak on qemuMonitor
	The current code pattern requires that callers of qemuMonitorClose
	check for the return value == 0, and if so, set priv->mon = NULL
	and release the reference held on the associated virDomainObjPtr

	The change d84bb6d6a3bd2fdd530184cc9743249ebddbee71 violated that
	requirement, meaning that priv->mon never gets set to NULL, and
	a reference count is leaked on virDomainObjPtr.

	This design was a bad one, so remove the need to check the return
	valueof qemuMonitorClose(). Instead allow registration of a
	callback that's invoked just when the last reference on qemuMonitorPtr
	is released.

	Finally there was a potential reference leak in qemuConnectMonitor
	in the failure path.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Add a destroy
	  callback invoked from qemuMonitorFree
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use the destroy callback to release the

	  potential reference count leak in connecting to monitor

2010-06-23  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make checks for inactive QEMU guest more robust
	Before issuing monitor commands it is neccessary to check whether
	the guest is still running. Most places use virDomainIsActive()
	correctly, but a few relied on 'priv->mon != NULL'. In theory
	these should be equivalent, but the release of the last reference
	count on priv->mon can be delayed a small amount of time until
	the event handler is finally deregistered. A further ref counting
	bug also means that priv->mon might be never released. In such a
	case, code could mistakenly issue a monitor command and wait for
	a response that will never arrive, effectively leaving the QEMU
	driver waiting on virCondWait() forever..

	To protect against these possibilities, make sure all code uses
	virDomainIsActive(), not 'priv->mon != NULL'

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Replace 'priv->mon != NULL' with
	  calls to 'priv->mon != NULL'()

	    Pool images_dir3 destroyed

	At this point the images_dir3 pool should be gone (because it was
	transient) and we should be able to create a new pool with the same name:

	    virsh # pool-create-as images_dir3 dir - - - - "/home/images2"
	    Pool images_dir3 created

	    virsh # pool-info images_dir3
	    Name:           images_dir3
	    UUID:           90301885-94eb-4ca7-14c2-f30b25a29a36
	    error: Storage pool not found

	The new pool got the same UUID as the first one, but we didn't specify
	one. libvirt should have picked a random UUID, but it didn't.

	It turned out that virStoragePoolIsPersistent leaks a reference to the
	storage pool object (actually remoteDispatchStoragePoolIsPersistent does).
	As a result, pool-destroy doesn't remove the virStoragePool for the
	"images_dir3" pool from the virConnectPtr's storagePools hash on libvirtd's
	side. Then the second pool-create-as get's the stale virStoragePool object
	associated with the "images_dir3" name. But this object has the old UUID.

	This commit ensures that all get_nonnull_* and make_nonnull_* calls for
	libvirt objects are matched properly with vir*Free calls. This fixes the
	reference leaks and the reported problem.

	All remoteDispatch*IsActive and remoteDispatch*IsPersistent functions were
	affected. But also remoteDispatchDomainMigrateFinish2 was affected in the
	success path. I wonder why that didn't surface earlier. Probably because
	domainMigrateFinish2 is executed on the destination host and in the common
	case this connection is opened especially for the migration and gets closed
	after the migration is done. So there was no chance to run into a problem
	because of the leaked reference.

	See https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=599091

	Saving a paused 512MB domain took 3m47s with the old block size of 512
	bytes. Changing the block size to 1024*1024 decreased the time to 56
	seconds. (Doubling again to 2048*1024 yielded 0 improvement; lowering
	to 512k increased the save time to 1m10s, about 20%)

	Fix dereference of potentially freed pointer in qemudDomainSaveFlags
	The pointer to the xml describing the domain is saved into an object
	prior to calling VIR_REALLOC_N() to make the size of the memory it
	points to a multiple of QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_TO_FILE_BS. If that
	operation needs to allocate new memory, the pointer that was saved is
	no longer valid.

	To avoid this situation, adjust the size *before* saving the pointer.

	(This showed up when experimenting with very large values of
	QEMU_MONITOR_MIGRATE_TO_FILE_BS).

	Allocate buffer to hold xend response
	There are cases when a response from xend can exceed 4096 bytes, in
	which case anything beyond 4096 is ignored. This patch changes the

	buffer based on Content-Length in HTTP header.

	Update nodedev scsi_host data before use
	* It appears that the udev event for HBA creation arrives before the
	  associated sysfs data is fully populated, resulting in bogus data
	  for the nodedev entry until the entry is refreshed.  This problem is
	  particularly troublesome when creating NPIV vHBAs because it results
	  in libvirt failing to find the newly created adapter and waiting for
	  the full timeout period before erroneously failing the create
	  operation.  This patch forces an update before any attempt to use
	  any scsi_host nodedev entry.

	phyp: Strict check when listing domains

2010-06-03  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	add 802.1Qbh and 802.1Qbg handling
	This patch that adds support for configuring 802.1Qbg and 802.1Qbh
	switches. The 802.1Qbh part has been successfully tested with real
	hardware. The 802.1Qbg part has only been tested with a (dummy)
	server that 'behaves' similarly to how we expect lldpad to 'behave'.

	The following changes were made during the development of this patch:

	 - Merging Scott's v13-pre1 patch
	 - Fixing endptr related bug while using virStrToLong_ui() pointed out
	   by Jim Meyering
	 - Addressing Jim Meyering's comments to v11
	 - requiring mac address to the vpDisassociateProfileId() function to
	   pass it further to the 802.1Qbg disassociate part (802.1Qbh untouched)
	 - determining pid of lldpad daemon by reading it from /var/run/libvirt.pid
	   (hardcode as is hardcode alson in lldpad sources)
	 - merging netlink send code for kernel target and user space target
	   (lldpad) using one function nlComm() to send the messages
	 - adding a select() after the sending and before the reading of the
	   netlink response in case lldpad doesn't respond and so we don't hang
	 - when reading the port status, in case of 802.1Qbg, no status may be
	   received while things are 'in progress' and only at the end a status
	   will be there.
	 - when reading the port status, use the given instanceId and vf to pick
	   the right IFLA_VF_PORT among those nested under IFLA_VF_PORTS.
	 - never sending nor parsing IFLA_PORT_SELF type of messages in the
	   802.1Qbg case
	 - iterating over the elements in a IFLA_VF_PORTS to pick the right
	   IFLA_VF_PORT by either IFLA_PORT_PROFILE and given profileId
	   (802.1Qbh) or IFLA_PORT_INSTANCE_UUID and given instanceId (802.1Qbg)
	   and reading the current status in IFLA_PORT_RESPONSE.
	 - recycling a previous patch that adds functionality to interface.c to
	   - get the vlan identifier on an interface
	   - get the flags of an interface and some convenience function to
	     check whether an interface is 'up' or not (not currently used here)
	 - adding function to determine the root physical interface of an
	   interface. For example if a macvtap is linked to eth0.100, it will
	   find eth0. Also adding a function that finds the vlan on the 'way to
	   the root physical interface'
	 - conveying the root physical interface name and index in case of 802.1Qbg
	 - conveying mac address of macvlan device and vlan identifier in
	   IFLA_VFINFO_LIST[ IFLA_VF_INFO[ IFLA_VF_MAC(mac), IFLA_VF_VLAN(vlan) ] ]
	   to (future) lldpad via netlink
	  - To enable build with --without-macvtap rename the
	    [dis|]associatePortProfileId functions, prepend 'vp' before their
	    name and make them non-static functions.
	  - Renaming variable multicast to nltarget_kernel and inverting
	    the logic
	  - Addressing Jim Meyering's comments; this also touches existing
	    code for example for correcting indentation of break statements or
	    simplification of switch statements.
	  - Renamed occurrencvirVirtualPortProfileDef to virVirtualPortProfileParamses
	  - 802.1Qbg part prepared for sending a RTM_SETLINK and getting
	    processing status back plus a subsequent RTM_GETLINK to
	    get IFLA_PORT_RESPONSE.
	    Note: This interface for 802.1Qbg may still change
	  - [David Allan] move getPhysfn inside IFLA_VF_PORT_MAX to avoid
	compiler
	    warning when latest if_link.h isn't available
	  - move from Stefan's 802.1Qb{g|h} XML v8 to v9
	  - move hostuuid and vf index calcs to inside doPortProfileOp8021Qbh
	  - remove debug fprintfs
	  - use virGetHostUUID (thanks Stefan!)
	  - fix compile issue when latest if_link.h isn't available
	  - change poll timeout to 10s, at 1/8 intervals
	     - if polling times out, log msg and return -ETIMEDOUT
	  - Add Stefan's code for getPortProfileStatus
	  - Poll for up to 2 secs for port-profile status, at 1/8 sec intervals:
	     - if status indicates error, abort openMacvtapTap
	     - if status indicates success, exit polling
	     - if status is "in-progress" after 2 secs of polling, exit
	       polling loop silently, without error

	My patch finishes out the 802.1Qbh parts, which Stefan had mostly complete.
	I've tested using the recent kernel updates for VF_PORT netlink msgs and
	enic for Cisco's 10G Ethernet NIC.  I tested many VMs, each with several
	direct interfaces, each configured with a port-profile per the XML.  VM-to-VM,
	and VM-to-external work as expected.  VM-to-VM on same host (using same NIC)
	works same as VM-to-VM where VMs are on diff hosts.  I'm able to change
	settings on the port-profile while the VM is running to change the virtual
	port behaviour.  For example, adjusting a QoS setting like rate limit.  All
	VMs with interfaces using that port-profile immediatly see the effect of the
	change to the port-profile.

	I don't have a SR-IOV device to test so source dev is a non-SR-IOV device,
	but most of the code paths include support for specifing the source dev and
	VF index.  We'll need to complete this by discovering the PF given the VF
	linkdev.  Once we have the PF, we'll also have the VF index.  All this info-
	mation is available from sysfs.

	Add --source-format argument to virsh pool-define-as and pool-create-as
	This is the corresponding patch for the virsh man page (virsh.pod).

2010-06-02  Justin Clift  <justin@salasaga.org>

	Add --source-format argument to virsh pool-define-as and pool-create-as
	When creating pools from dedicated disks, the existing pool-define-as
	and pool-create-as commands are a bit non-optimal.

	Ideally, a person would be able to specify all of the required options
	directly on the command line instead of having to edit the XML.

	At the moment, there is no way to specify the format type (ie gpt) so it
	gets included in the XML the pool is constructed with.

	Please find attached a simple (tested) patch to add an optional
	"--source-format 'type'" to virsh.  This is patched against current git
	master and will apply cleanly.

	Also created a Red Hat BZ ticket for this (#597790) for tracking.

	    was missing.

	storage: Check for invalid storage mode before opening
	If a directory pool contains pipes or sockets, a pool start can fail or hang:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=589577

	We already try to avoid these special files, but only attempt after
	opening the path, which is where the problems lie. Unify volume opening
	into helper functions, which use the proper open() flags to avoid error,
	followed by fstat to validate storage mode.

	Previously, virStorageBackendUpdateVolTargetInfoFD attempted to enforce the
	storage mode check, but allowed callers to detect this case and silently
	continue. In practice, only the FS backend was using this feature, the rest
	were treating unknown mode as an error condition. Unfortunately the InfoFD
	function wasn't raising an error message here, so error reporting was
	busted.

	This patch adds 2 functions: virStorageBackendVolOpen, and
	virStorageBackendVolOpenModeSkip. The latter retains the original opt out
	semantics, the former now throws an explicit error.

	This patch maintains the previous volume mode checks: allowing specific
	modes for specific pool types requires a bit of surgery, since VolOpen
	is called through several different helper functions.

	v2: Use ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL. Drop stat check, just open with
	    O_NONBLOCK|O_NOCTTY.

	v3: Move mode check logic back to VolOpen. Use 2 VolOpen functions with
	    different error semantics.

	v4: Make second VolOpen function more extensible. Didn't opt to change
	    FS backend defaults, this can just be to fix the original bug.

	v5: Prefix default flags with VIR_, use ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK

	macvtap: cannot support target device name
	Since the macvtap device needs active tear-down and the teardown logic
	is based on the interface name, it can happen that if for example 1 out
	of 3 interfaces was successfully created, that during the failure path
	the macvtap's target device name is used to tear down an interface that
	is doesn't own (owned by another VM).

	So, in this patch, the target interface name is reset so that there is
	no target interface name and the interface name is always cleared after
	a tear down.

	network: bridge: Don't start network if it collides with host routing
	Fedora bug https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=235961

	If using the default virtual network, an easy way to lose guest network
	connectivity is to install libvirt inside the VM. The autostarted
	default network inside the guest collides with host virtual network
	routing. This is a long standing issue that has caused users quite a
	bit of pain and confusion.

	On network startup, parse /proc/net/route and compare the requested
	IP+netmask against host routing destinations: if any matches are found,
	refuse to start the network.

	v2: Drop sscanf, fix a comment typo, comment that function could use
	    libnl instead of /proc

	v3: Consider route netmask. Compare binary data rather than convert to

	    return result;

	  failure:
	    <cleanup code in case of an error>
	    result = -1;
	    goto cleanup
	}

	with this simpler pattern:

	int
	some_random_function(void)
	{
	    int result = -1;
	    ...
	    result = 0;

	  cleanup:

	        <cleanup code in case of an error>
	    }

	    <unconditional cleanup code>
	    return result;
	}

	Add a bool success variable in functions that don't have a int result
	that can be used for the new pattern.

	Fix failing virGetHostname.
	We've been running into a lot of situations where
	virGetHostname() is returning "localhost", where a plain
	gethostname() would have returned the correct thing.  This
	is because virGetHostname() is *always* trying to canonicalize
	the name returned from gethostname(), even when it doesn't
	have to.

	This patch changes virGetHostname so that if the value returned
	from gethostname() is already FQDN or localhost, it returns
	that string directly.  If the value returned from gethostname()
	is a shortened hostname, then we try to canonicalize it.  If
	that succeeds, we returned the canonicalized hostname.  If
	that fails, and/or returns "localhost", then we just return
	the original string we got from gethostname() and hope for
	the best.

	Note that after this patch it is up to clients to check whether
	"localhost" is an allowed return value.  The only place
	where it's currently not is in qemu migration.

	vepa: parsing for 802.1Qb{g|h} XML
	This patch parses the following two XML descriptions, one for
	802.1Qbg and one for 802.1Qbh, and stores the data internally.
	The actual triggering of the switch setup protocol has not been
	implemented here but the relevant code to do that should go into
	the functions associatePortProfileId() and disassociatePortProfileId().

	   <interface type='direct'>
	      <source dev='eth0.100' mode='vepa'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <virtualport type='802.1Qbg'>
	        <parameters managerid='12' typeid='0x123456' typeidversion='1'
	         instanceid='fa9b7fff-b0a0-4893-8e0e-beef4ff18f8f'/>
	      </virtualport>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'/>
	    </interface>

	    <interface type='direct'>
	      <source dev='eth0.100' mode='vepa'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <virtualport type='802.1Qbh'>
	        <parameters profileid='my_profile'/>
	      </virtualport>
	    </interface>

	I'd suggest to use this patch as a base for triggering the setup
	protocol with the 802.1Qb{g|h} switch.

	Several rounds of changes were made to this patch. The
	following is a list of these changes.
	- Renamed structure virVirtualPortProfileDef to virVirtualPortProfileParams
	  as per Daniel Berrange's request
	- Addressing Daniel Berrange's comments:
	 - removing macvtap.h's dependency on domain_conf.h by
	   moving the virVirtualPortProfileDef structure into macvtap.h
	   and not passing virtDomainNetDefPtr to any functions in
	   macvtap.c
	- Addressed most of Chris Wright's comments:
	  - indicating error in case virtualport XML node cannot be parsed
	    properly
	  - parsing hex and decimal numbers using virStrToLong_ui() with
	    parameter '0' for base
	  - tgifname (target interface name) variable wasn't necessary
	    to pass to openMacvtapTap function anymore
	- assigning the virtual port data structure to the virDomainNetDef
	  only if it was previously parsed
	- make sure that the error code returned by openMacvtapTap() is a negative n
	  in case the associatePortProfileId() function failed.
	- renaming vsi in the XML to virtualport
	- replace all occurrences of vsi in the source as well
	- removing mode and MAC address parameters from the functions that
	  will communicate with the hareware diretctly or indirectly
	- moving the associate and disassociate functions to the end of the
	  file for subsequent patches to easier make them generally available
	  for export
	- passing the macvtap interface name rather than the link device since
	  this otherwise gives funny side effects when using netlink messages
	  where IFLA_IFNAME and IFLA_ADDRESS are specified and the link dev
	  all of a sudden gets the MAC address of the macvtap interface.
	- Removing rc = -1 error indications in the case of 802.1Qbg|h setup in case
	  we wanted to use hook scripts for the setup and so the setup doesn't fail
	  here.
	- if instance ID UUID is not supplied it will automatically be generated
	  - adapted schema to make instance ID UUID optional
	  - added test case
	- parser and XML generator have been separated into their own
	  functions so they can be re-used elsewhere (passthrough case
	  for example)
	- Adapted XML parser and generator support the above shown type
	  (802.1Qbg, 802.1Qbh).
	- Adapted schema to above XML
	- Adapted test XML to above XML
	- Passing through the VM's UUID which seems to be necessary for
	  802.1Qbh -- sorry no host UUID
	- adding virtual function ID to association function, in case it's
	  necessary to use (for SR-IOV)

	vepa+vsi: Introduce dependency on libnl
	This patch introduces a dependency on libnl, which subsequent patches

2010-05-26  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	storage: Sanitize pool target paths
	Spurious / in a pool target path makes life difficult for apps using the
	GetVolByPath, and doing other path based comparisons with pools. This
	has caused a few issues for virt-manager users:

	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=494005
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=593565

	Add a new util API which removes spurious /, virFileSanitizePath. Sanitize
	target paths when parsing pool XML, and for paths passed to GetVolByPath.

	v2: Leading // must be preserved, properly sanitize path=/, sanitize
	    away /./ -> /

	v3: Properly handle starting ./ and ending /.

	v4: Drop all '.' handling, just sanitize / for now.

	Fix handling of disk backing stores with cgroups
	The cgroups ACL code was only allowing the primary disk image.
	It is possible to chain images together, so we need to search
	for backing stores and add them to the ACL too. Since the ACL
	only handles block devices, we ignore the EINVAL we get from
	plain files. In addition it was missing code to teardown the
	cgroup when hot-unplugging a disk

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Allow backing stores in cgroup ACLs
	  and add missing teardown code in unplug path

2010-05-25  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up basic migration.
	Basic live migration was broken by the commit that added
	non-shared block support in two ways:

	1)  It added a virCheckFlags() to doNativeMigrate().  Besides
	the fact that typical usage of virCheckFlags() is in driver
	entry points, and doNativeMigrate() is not an entry point,
	it was missing important flags like VIR_MIGRATE_LIVE.  Move
	the virCheckFlags to the top-level qemuDomainMigratePrepare2
	and friends.

	2)  It also added a memory leak in qemuMonitorTextMigrate()
	by not freeing the memory used by virBufferContentAndReset().
	This is fixed by storing the pointer in a temporary variable
	and freeing it at the end.

	With this patch in place, normal live migration works again.

	v3: Instead of the churn for virCheckFlagsUI and UL, instead
	always promote flags to an unsigned long and always use %lx
	for the fprintf.
	v2: Add back flags check, which required adding virCheckFlagsUI
	and virCheckFlagsUL

	qemu: Allow using regular audio backends with VNC
	Currently all host audio backends are disabled if a VM is using VNC, in
	favor of the QEMU VNC audio extension. Unfortunately no released VNC
	client supports this extension, so users have no way of getting audio
	to work if using VNC.

	Add a new config option in qemu.conf which allows changing libvirt's
	behavior, but keep the default intact.

	v2: Fix doc typos, change name to vnc_allow_host_audio

	Allow nwfilter functions to be compiled with C++
	Unfortunately the NWFilter functions were outside of the
	"extern C { ... }" declaration in include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in,
	which means that they couldn't be properly used with C++.  Move
	them inside of the braces, which should fix the problem.

	Query block allocation extent from QEMU monitor
	The virDomainGetBlockInfo API allows query physical block
	extent and allocated block extent. These are normally the
	same value unless storing a special format like qcow2
	inside a block device. In this scenario we can query QEMU
	to get the actual allocated extent.

	Since last time:

	 - Return fatal error in text monitor
	 - Only invoke monitor command for block devices
	 - Fix error handling JSON code

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fill in block aloction extent when VM
	  is running
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Add

	Also, virCgroupSetCpuShares could fail without evoking a diagnostic.
	Add one.

	libvirtd: start each diagnostic with "argv0: "
	Some diagnostics had a hard-coded "libvirtd: " prefix, some used
	"error: " and some used "argv[0]: ".  Always use "argv[0]: ".
	* daemon/libvirtd.c (argv0): New global.
	(main): Set it.
	(version, usage): Remove argv0 parameter.  Use global; update callers.
	(daemonForkIntoBackground): Use argv0:, not error:.
	(qemudWritePidFile): Start each diagnostic with argv0:.
	Suggested by Eric Blake.

	each embedded, configuration-dependent, macro with an `%s'.

	libvirtd: don't ignore virInitialize failure
	* daemon/libvirtd.c (main): Diagnose virInitialize failure

	Fix race in finding available vnc port
	The qemu driver contains a subtle race in the logic to find next
	available vnc port.  Currently it iterates through all available ports
	and returns the first for which bind(2) succeeds.  However it is possible
	that a previously issued port has not yet been bound by qemu, resulting
	in the same port used for a subsequent domain.

	This patch addresses the race by using a simple bitmap to "reserve" the
	ports allocated by libvirt.

	V2:
	  - Put port bitmap in struct qemud_driver
	  - Initialize bitmap in qemudStartup

	V3:
	  - Check for failure of virBitmapGetBit
	  - Additional check for port != -1 before calling virbitmapClearBit

	V4:
	  - Check for failure of virBitmap{Set,Clear}Bit

	Add simple bitmap operations to utils
	V2:
	  - Move bitmap impl to src/util/bitmap.[ch]
	  - Use CHAR_BIT instead of explicit '8'
	  - Use size_t instead of unsigned int
	  - Fix calculation of bitmap size in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Ensure bit is within range of map in the set, clear, and get
	    operations
	  - Use bool in virBitmapGetBit
	  - Add virBitmapFree to free-like funcs in cfg.mk

	V3:
	  - Check for overflow in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Fix copy and paste bug in virBitmapAlloc
	  - Use size_t in prototypes
	  - Add ATTRIBUTE_NONNULL in prototypes where appropriate
	    and remove NULL check from impl

	V4:
	  - Add ATTRIBUTE_RETURN_CHECK in prototypes where appropriate.

	daemon: Export SDL audio environment variables
	/etc/sysconfig/libvirtd has a few environment variables for configuring
	libvirt SDL audio. The libvirtd process doesn't see these, however, because
	they are never exported. Let's export the variables after sourcing the
	sysconfig script.

	There is another problem here that the commented out values in the
	sysconfig script are not neccessarily the actual defaults, we are qemus
	mercy here. Not sure how to solve that.

	Autostart domains using virDomainObjStart

	Refactor qemudDomainStart
	We need a common internal function for starting managed domains to be
	used during autostart. This patch factors out relevant code from
	qemudDomainStart into qemudDomainObjStart and makes it use the
	refactored code for domain restore instead of calling qemudDomainRestore
	API directly.

	Factor out def assignment to existing domain from virDomainAssignDef
	We need to be able to assign new def to an existing virDomainObj which
	is already locked. This patch factors out the relevant code from
	virDomainAssignDef into virDomainObjAssignDef.

	Refactor qemudDomainRestore
	We need to be able to restore a domain which we already locked and
	started a job for it without undoing these steps. This patch factors
	out internals of qemudDomainRestore into separate functions which work
	for locked objects.

	Domain snapshot RNG and tests.

2010-05-21  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up the python bindings for snapshotting.
	This involved a few fixes.  To start with,
	an virDomainSnapshot object is really tied to a
	domain, not a connection, so we have to generate
	a slightly different object so that we can get
	at self._dom for the object.

	Next, we had to "dummy" up an override piece of
	XML with a bogus argument that the function doesn't
	actually take.  That's so that the generator places
	virDomainRevertToSnapshot underneath the correct
	class (namely, the virDomain class).

	Finally, we had to hand-implement the
	virDomainRevertToSnapshot implementation, ignoring the
	bogus pointer we are being passed.

	With all of this in place, I was able to successfully
	take a snapshot and revert to it using only the
	Python bindings.

	tests: the remote_protocol check also accommodates older pdwtags
	This test was failing on systems using pdwtags from dwarves-1.3.
	Reported by Matthias Bolte.
	Two-pronged fix:
	  - use --verbose to work also with dwarves-1.3; adapt regular
	    expressions to handle now-varying separators
	  - require a minimum number of post-split clauses, in order to
	    skip upon any future format change.

	Protect against NULL pointer flaws in monitor usage
	History has shown that there are frequent bugs in the QEMU driver
	code leading to the monitor being invoked with a NULL pointer.
	Although the QEMU driver code should always report an error in
	this case before invoking the monitor, as a safety net put in a
	generic check in the monitor code entry points.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Safety net to check for NULL monitor
	  object

2010-05-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix multiple potential NULL pointer references in monitor usage
	Any method which intends to invoke a monitor command must have
	a check for virDomainObjIsActive() before using the monitor to
	ensure that priv->mon != NULL.

	There is one subtle edge case in this though. If a method invokes
	multiple monitor commands, and calls qemuDomainObjExitMonitor()
	in between two of these commands then there is no guarentee that
	priv->mon != NULL anymore. This is because the QEMU process may
	exit or die at any time, and because qemuDomainObjEnterMonitor()
	releases the lock on virDomainObj, it is possible for the background
	thread to close the monitor handle and thus qemuDomainObjExitMonitor
	will release the last reference allowing priv->mon to become NULL.

	This affects several methods, most notably migration but also some
	hotplug methods. This patch takes a variety of approaches to solve
	the problem, depending on the particular usage scenario. Generally
	though it suffices to add an extra virDomainObjIsActive() check
	if qemuDomainObjExitMonitor() was called during the method.

	Make domain save work when dynamic_ownership=0
	Setting dynamic_ownership=0 in /etc/libvirt/qemu.conf prevents
	libvirt's DAC security driver from setting uid/gid on disk
	files when starting/stopping QEMU, allowing the admin to manage
	this manually. As a side effect it also stopped setting of
	uid/gid when saving guests to a file, which completely breaks
	save when QEMU is running non-root. Thus saved state labelling

	Don't reset user/group/security label on shared filesystems during migrate
	When QEMU runs with its disk on NFS, and as a non-root user, the
	disk is chownd to that non-root user. When migration completes
	the last step is shutting down the QEMU on the source host. THis
	normally resets user/group/security label. This is bad when the
	VM was just migrated because the file is still in use on the dest

	Fix monitor ref counting when adding event handle
	When closing a monitor using qemuMonitorClose(), we are aware of
	the possibility the monitor is still being used somewhere:

	    /* NB: ordinarily one might immediately set mon->watch to -1
	     * and mon->fd to -1, but there may be a callback active
	     * that is still relying on these fields being valid. So
	     * we merely close them, but not clear their values and
	     * use this explicit 'closed' flag to track this state */

	but since we call virEventAddHandle() on that monitor without increasing
	its ref counter, the monitor is still freed which makes possible users
	of it quite unhappy. The unhappiness can lead to a hang if qemuMonitorIO
	tries to lock mutex which no longer exists.

2010-05-12  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Remove watches before calling REMOTE_PROC_CLOSE
	First calling REMOTE_PROC_CLOSE and then removing watches might lead to
	a hang as HANGUP event can be triggered before the watches are actually
	removed but after virConnectPtr is already freed. As a result of that

	Support for live migration between hosts that do not share storage was

	It supports two flags:
	-b migration without shared storage with full disk copy
	-i migration without shared storage with incremental copy (same base image
	shared between source and destination).

	I tested the live migration without shared storage (both flags) for native
	and p2p with and without tunnelling.  I also verified that the fix doesn't
	affect normal migration with shared storage.

	configure.ac: Avoid uname, which breaks cross-compilation
	When cross-compiling on Linux, configure will misdetect the target as

	nwfilter: skip some interfaces on filter update
	When a filter is updated, only those interfaces must have their old
	rules cleared that either reference the filter directly or indirectly
	through another filter. Remember between the different steps of the
	instantiation of the filters which interfaces must be skipped. I am
	using a hash map to remember the names of the interfaces and store a
	bogus pointer to ~0 into it that need not be freed.

	pass info where request stems from to have rules applied
	For the decision on whether to instantiate the rules, the check for a
	pending IP address learn request is not sufficient since then only the
	thread could instantiate the rules. So, a boolean needs to be passed
	when the thread instantiates the filter rules late and the IP address
	learn request is still pending in order to override the check for the
	pending learn request. If the rules are to be updated while the thread
	is active, this will not be done immediately but the thread will do that
	later on.

	In commit 98fb83ce25f46e0236706fa6e0943032d921935f I changed the

	nwfilter: Also pick IP address from a DHCP ACK message
	The local DHCP server on virtbr0 sends DHCP ACK messages when a VM is

	if that type of message is seen.

	Fix virt-pki-validate's determination of CN
	Ubuntu's gntls package generates an Issuer line that looks like this:
	        Issuer: C=US,ST=NY,L=Rochester,O=example.com,CN=example.com CA,EMAIL=hostmaster@example.com

	While Red Hat's looks like this
	Issuer: CN=Red Hat Emerging Technologies

	Note the leading whitespace, and the additional fields in the former.

	This patch updates the regular expression to:
	 * trim leading characters before "Issuer:"
	 * trim anything between Issuer: and CN=
	 * trim anything after the next ,

	I've tested this against the certool output of both RH and Ubuntu

	Add virDomainGetBlockInfo API to query disk sizing

	Normally 'physical' and 'allocation' will be identical, but
	in the case of a qcow2-like file stored inside a block device
	'physical' will give the block device size, while 'allocation'
	will give the qcow2 image size

	Fix a virsh edit memory leak
	When running virsh edit, we are unlinking and setting
	the tmp variable to NULL before going to the end of the

	Fix a qemuDomainPCIAddressSetFree memory leak
	qemuDomainPCIAddressSetFree was freeing up the hash

	so do that here.

	Fix a memory leak in the node_device_udev code
	We were over-writing a pointer without freeing it in

	is mis-using LDADD; it shouldn't be putting direct paths to

	Fix handling of security driver restore failures in QEMU domain save
	In cases where the security driver failed to restore a label after a
	guest has saved, we mistakenly jumped to the error cleanup paths.
	This is not good, because the operation has in fact completed and
	cannot be rolled back completely. Label restore is non-critical, so
	just log the problem instead. Also add a missing restore call in
	the error cleanup path

2010-04-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix QEMU domain save to block devices with cgroups enabled
	When cgroups is enabled, access to block devices is likely to be
	restricted to a whitelist. Prior to saving a guest to a block device,
	it is necessary to add the block device to the whitelist. This is
	not required upon restore, since QEMU reads from stdin

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add block device to cgroups whitelist
	  if neccessary during domain save.

2010-04-28  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix QEMU save/restore with block devices
	The save process was relying on use of the shell >> append
	operator to ensure the save data was placed after the libvirt
	header + XML. This doesn't work for block devices though.
	Replace this code with use of 'dd' and its 'seek' parameter.
	This means that we need to pad the header + XML out to a
	multiple of dd block size (in this case we choose 512).

	The qemuMonitorMigateToCommand() monitor API is used for both
	save/coredump, and migration via UNIX socket. We can't simply
	switch this to use 'dd' since this causes problems with the
	migration usage. Thus, create a dedicated qemuMonitorMigateToFile
	which can accept an filename + offset, and remove the filename
	from the current qemuMonitorMigateToCommand() API

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Switch to qemuMonitorMigateToFile
	  for save and core dump
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,

	Avoid create/unlink with block devs used for QEMU save

	nwfilter: let qemu's after-migration packet pass
	Qemu currently sends an Ethernet packet with protocol id 0x835 once a VM
	was successfully migrated. The content of the packet looks like a
	gratuitous RARP, just with the wrong protocol ID, which should be
	0x8035. I wrote some filters to let either one of the packets pass and
	am adapting the clean-traffic sample filter to use it. I am also
	doing some changes on the existing ARP filter which was lacking a
	test for source MAC address.

	nwfilter: add support for RAPR protocol
	This patch adds support for the RARP protocol. This may be needed due to
	qemu sending out a RARP packet (at least that's what it seems to want to
	do even though the protocol id is wrong) when migration finishes and
	we'd need a rule to let the packets pass.

	Unfortunately my installation of ebtables does not understand -p RARP
	and also seems to otherwise depend on strings in /etc/ethertype
	translated to protocol identifiers. Therefore I need to pass -p 0x8035
	for RARP. To generally get rid of the dependency of that file I switch
	all so far supported protocols to use their protocol identifier in the
	-p parameter rather than the string.

	I am also extending the schema and added a test case.

	changes from v1 to v2:
	- added test case into patch

2010-04-27  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Ignore qemu STOP event when stopping CPUs
	With JSON qemu monitor, we get a STOP event from qemu whenever qemu
	stops guests CPUs. The downside of it is that vm->state is changed to
	PAUSED and a new generic paused event is send to applications. However,
	when we ask qemu to stop the CPUs we are not really interested in qemu
	event and we usually want to issue a more specific event.

	By setting vm->status to PAUSED before actually sending the request to
	qemu (and resetting it back if the request fails) we can ignore the
	event since the event handler does nothing when the guest is already
	paused. This solution is quite hacky but unfortunately it's the best
	solution which I was able to come up with and it doesn't introduce a
	race condition.

	Fix indentation for storage conf XML

	Changes from V1 to V2:  - using INT_BUFSIZE_BOUND() to determine the length of the buffersize for printing and integer into
	 - not explicitly initializing static var threadsTerminate to false
	anymore, since that's done automatically

	Changes after V2:
	  - removed while looks in case of OOM error
	  - removed on ifaceDown() call
	  - preceding one ifaceDown() call with an ifaceCheck() call

	Since the name of an interface can be the same between stops and starts
	of different VMs I have to switch the IP address learning thread to use
	the index of the interface to determine whether an interface is still
	available or not - in the case of macvtap the thread needs to listen for
	traffic on the physical interface, thus having to time out periodically
	to check whether the VM's macvtap device is still there as an indication
	that the VM is still alive. Previously the following sequence of 2 VMs
	with macvtap device

	virsh start testvm1; virsh destroy testvm1 ; virsh start testvm2

	would not terminate the thread upon testvm1's destroy since the name of
	the interface on the host could be the same (i.e, macvtap0) on testvm1
	and testvm2, thus it was easily race-able. The thread would then
	determine the IP address parameter for testvm2 but apply the rule set
	for testvm1. :-(
	I am also introducing a lock for the interface (by name) that the thread
	must hold while it listens for the traffic and releases when it
	terminates upon VM termination or 0.5 second thereafter. Thus, the new

	Fix locking in qemudDomainCoreDump
	The hang fix in d376b7d63ec1ef24ba4c812d58b9a414ddb561f8 was incomplete
	since it left quite a few {Enter,Exit}Monitor calls which require driver
	to be unlocked. Since the driver is locked throughout the whole
	function, {Enter,Exit}MonitorWithDriver need to be used instead to
	ensure driver is not locked when issuing monitor commands.

	Poll for migration end every 50ms instead of 50us
	The comment in qemuDomainWaitForMigrationComplete says we are polling
	every 50ms but the code sleeps only for 50us. This was already discussed
	during review but apparently forgotten when the series was pushed.

	Fake host CPU for qemu tests

	Use configured CPU model if possible
	Adds ability to provide a preferred CPU model for CPUID data decoding.
	Such model would be considered as the best possible model (if it's
	supported by hypervisor) regardless on number of features which have to
	be added or removed for describing required CPU.

2010-04-22  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Support removing features when converting data to CPU
	So far, when CPUID data were converted into CPU model and features, the
	features can only be added to the model. As a result, when a guest asked
	for something like "qemu64,-svm" it would get a qemu32 plus a bunch of
	additional features instead.

	This patch adds support for removing feature from the base model.
	Selection algorithm remains the same: the best CPU model is the model
	which requires lowest number of features to be added/removed from it.

2010-04-22  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Move MIN macro to util.h so that others can use it

	Deal with CPU models in []
	Qemu committed a patch which list some CPU names in [] when asked for
	supported CPUs (qemu -cpu ?). Yet, it needs such CPUs to be passed
	without those square braces. When probing for supported CPU models, we
	can just strip the square braces and pretend we have never seen them.

	Fix initial VCPU pinning in qemu driver
	First, inital VCPU pinning is set correctly but then it is reset by
	assigning qemu process to a new cgroup (which contains all CPUs). It's
	easily fixed by swapping these two actions.

	Make avahi startup more robust.
	If the hostname of the current virtualization machine
	could not be resolved, then libvirtd would fail to
	start.  However, for disconnected operation (on a laptop,

	be resolvable.  This patch makes it so that if we can't
	resolve the hostname, avahi doesn't fail, it just uses
	a less useful MDNS string.

	esx: Don't treat an empty root snapshot list as error
	An empty root snapshot list was considered as error condition. Creating a
	new snapshot would fail if the domain didn't have snapshots yet, because
	the snapshot-create function tries to lookup the list of existing snapshots
	in order to verify that the snapshot name is unique. This fails if the

	build: avoid compiler warning
	According to GCC, ATTRIBUTE_UNUSED means that an attribute _might_

	Install nwfilter xml files from source directory.
	During an out-of-tree build, the current working directory is the build
	directory. Since the FILTERS are static and not modified or
	auto-generated during the build process, they need to be explicitly
	fetched from the source directory during install.

	Prefix the files with $(srcdir), which gets expanded to the absolute or

2010-04-20  Philipp Hahn  <hahn@univention.de>

	Don't ship generated python/libvirt.? files.
	libvirt.c and libvirt.h are auto-generated files. Mentioning their names
	in *_SOURCES includes them in the distribution. During an out-of-tree
	build these shipped files are included instead of the auto-generated
	version, potentially breaking the build (as it happend in 0.8.0, because

	Use virCheckFlags for APIs added in 0.8.0

2010-04-16  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Introduce virCheckFlags for consistent flags checking
	The idea is that every API implementation in driver which has flags
	parameter should first call virCheckFlags() macro to check the function
	was called with supported flags:

	    virCheckFlags(VIR_SUPPORTED_FLAG_1 |
	                  VIR_SUPPORTED_FLAG_2 |
	                  VIR_ANOTHER_SUPPORTED_FLAG, -1);

	The error massage which is printed when unsupported flags are passed
	looks like:

	    invalid argument in virFooBar: unsupported flags (0x2)

	Where the unsupported flags part only prints those flags which were
	passed but are not supported rather than all flags passed.

	Disk devices in QEMU have two parts, the guest device and the host

	The QEMU developers have stated that they will not be porting

	and 'device_del'. libvirt has (untested) code that would have
	supported those commands in theory, but since we already use

	nwfilter: use virFindFileInPath for needed CLI tools
	I am getting rid of determining the path to necessary CLI tools at
	compile time. Instead, now the firewall driver has an initialization
	function that uses virFindFileInPath() to determine the path to
	necessary CLI tools and a shutdown function to free allocated memory.
	The rest of the patch mostly deals with availability of the CLI tools
	and to not call certain code blocks if a tool is not available and that
	strings now have to be built slightly differently.

	nwfilter: fix for directionality of ICMP traffic
	Changes from V1 to V2 of this patch
	- I had reversed the logic thinking that icmp type 0 is a echo

	- Found that ebtables takes the --ip-tos argument only as a hex number

	This patch enables the skipping of some of the ICMP traffic rules on the

	properly enables unidirectional pings:

	<filter name='testcase'>
	    <uuid>d6b1a2af-def6-2898-9f8d-4a74e3c39558</uuid>
	    <!-- allow incoming ICMP Echo Request -->

	    <!-- allow outgoing ICMP Echo Reply -->
	    <rule action='accept' direction='out' priority='500'>
	        <icmp type='0'/>
	    </rule>
	    <!-- drop all other ICMP traffic -->

	nwfilter: Support for learning a VM's IP address
	This patch implements support for learning a VM's IP address. It uses
	the pcap library to listen on the VM's backend network interface (tap)
	or the physical ethernet device (macvtap) and tries to capture packets
	with source or destination MAC address of the VM and learn from DHCP
	Offers, ARP traffic, or first-sent IPv4 packet what the IP address of
	the VM's interface is. This then allows to instantiate the network
	traffic filtering rules without the user having to provide the IP
	parameter somewhere in the filter description or in the interface
	description as a parameter. This only supports to detect the parameter
	IP, which is for the assumed single IPv4 address of a VM. There is not
	support for interfaces that may have multiple  IP addresses (IP
	aliasing) or IPv6 that may then require more than one valid IP address
	to be detected. A VM can have multiple independent interfaces that each
	uses a different IP address and in that case it will be attempted to
	detect each one of the address independently.

	So, when for example an interface description in the domain XML has
	looked like this up to now:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <source bridge='mybridge'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'>
	        <parameter name='IP' value='10.2.3.4'/>
	      </filterref>
	    </interface>

	you may omit the IP parameter:

	    <interface type='bridge'>
	      <source bridge='mybridge'/>
	      <model type='virtio'/>
	      <filterref filter='clean-traffic'/>
	    </interface>

	Internally I am walking the 'tree' of a VM's referenced network filters
	and determine with the given variables which variables are missing. Now,
	the above IP parameter may be missing and this causes a libvirt-internal
	thread to be started that uses the pcap library's API to listen to the
	backend interface  (in case of macvtap to the physical interface) in an
	attempt to determine the missing IP parameter. If the backend interface
	disappears the thread terminates assuming the VM was brought down. In
	case of a macvtap device a timeout is being used to wait for packets
	from the given VM (filtering by VM's interface MAC address). If the VM's
	macvtap device disappeared the thread also terminates. In all other
	cases it tries to determine the IP address of the VM and will then apply
	the rules late on the given interface, which would have happened
	immediately if the IP parameter had been explicitly given. In case an
	error happens while the firewall rules are applied, the VM's backend
	interface is 'down'ed preventing it to communicate. Reasons for failure
	for applying the network firewall rules may that an ebtables/iptables
	command failes or OOM errors. Essentially the same failure reasons may
	occur as when the firewall rules are applied immediately on VM start,
	except that due to the late application of the filtering rules the VM
	now is already running and cannot be hindered anymore from starting.
	Bringing down the whole VM would probably be considered too drastic.
	While a VM's IP address is attempted to be determined only limited
	updates to network filters are allowed. In particular it is prevented
	that filters are modified in such a way that they would introduce new
	variables.

	A caveat: The algorithm does not know which one is the appropriate IP
	address of a VM. If the VM spoofs an IP address in its first ARP traffic
	or IPv4 packets its filtering rules will be instantiated for this IP
	address, thus 'locking' it to the found IP address. So, it's still
	'safer' to explicitly provide the IP address of a VM's interface in the
	filter description if it is known beforehand.

	nwfilter: Add filter schema for nwfilter XML, extend domain XML schema
	This patch adds a relaxng nwfilter schema along with a test that

	nwfilter: Fix instantiated layer 2 rules for 'inout' direction
	With Eric Blake's suggestions applied.

	The following rule for direction 'in'

	<rule direction='in' action='drop'>
	  <mac srcmacaddr='1:2:3:4:5:6'/>
	</rule>

	drops all traffic from the given mac address.
	The following rule for direction 'out'

	<rule direction='out' action='drop'>
	  <mac dstmacaddr='1:2:3:4:5:6'/>
	</rule>

	drops all traffic to the given mac address.
	The following rule in direction 'inout'

	<rule direction='inout' action='drop'>
	  <mac srcmacaddr='1:2:3:4:5:6'/>
	</rule>

	now drops all traffic from and to the given MAC address.
	So far it would have dropped traffic from the given MAC address
	and outgoing traffic with the given source MAC address, which is not useful
	since the packets will always have the VM's MAC address as source
	MAC address. The attached patch fixes this.

	This is the last bug I currently know of and want to fix.

2010-04-06  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Better error reporting in virsh.
	When hitting failures in virsh, a common idiom is
	to jump to a cleanup label, free some resources, and
	then return a FALSE error code to vshCommandRun.
	In theory, vshCommandRun is then supposed to print
	out the last error.  The problem is that many of
	the cleanup paths have library calls to free resources,
	and all of those library calls clear out the last error.
	This is leading to situations where no error is being
	reported at all.

	This patch remedies the situation somewhat by
	printing out the errors inside the command methods
	themselves when we know it will go through a cleanup
	path that will lose the error.

2010-04-06  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Website documentation for the snapshot XML.

	Increase the number of available VNC ports.
	When starting up qemu VNC autoport guests, we were

	limit to 65535 (the last available port), so we can
	have up to 59635 VNC autoport guests.

	Implement managed save operations for qemu driver
	The images are saved in /var/lib/libvirt/qemu/save/
	and named $domainname.save . The directory is created appropriately
	at daemon startup. When a domain is started while a saved image is
	available, libvirt will try to load this saved image, and start the
	domain as usual in case of failure. In any case the saved image is
	discarded once the domain is created.

	Add managed save API entry points
	virDomainManagedSave() is to be run on a running domain. Once the call
	complete, as in virDomainSave() the domain is stopped upon completion,
	but there is no restore counterpart as any order to start the domain
	from the API would load the state from the managed file, similary if
	the domain is autostarted when libvirtd starts.
	Once a domain has restarted his managed save image is destroyed,
	basically managed save image can only exist for a stopped domain,
	for a running domain that would be by definition outdated data.

	build: improve check for out-of-date .gnulib submodule
	git reset --hard 96e5a2d4d5b13bf2cc887562dc11d146b78d5950
	./autogen.sh
	make -s
	git pull
	make -s    <-- expecting auto-bootstrap here, doesn't happen

	Use git diff to expose whether the submodule has untracked changes,
	which are typical on an incremental pull if .gnulib was updated but
	the user did not manually run 'git submodule update'.

	After this patch is applied, I encountered a new problem when
	following the reproducing pattern.  Basically, the change to .gnulib
	between libvirt's commit 96e5a2d4 and this patch introduced a change
	to sys_ioctl.in.h, but gnulib (intentionally) does not make the
	replacement headers depend on Makefile changes.  Therefore, I ended up
	with the generated replacement header being broken:
	gnulib/lib/sys/ioctl.h complained about a use of @.  But that seems
	like something that should be fixed upstream in gnulib's bootstrap
	script (that is, when doing a gnulib update, all files created from
	.in.h file should probably be deleted).  Without the benefit of that
	proposed gnulib fix, I worked around the problem by manually removing
	the stale gnulib/lib/sys/ioctl.h.

	* autogen.sh (t): Also run bootstrap if the gnulib submodule needs
	to be updated.
	* cfg.mk (_autogen): Likewise.
	Reported by Matthias Bolte.

	The following issues are fixed in the patch below:
	- ebtables requires that some of the command line parameters are passed as hex numbers; so have those attributes call a function that prints 16 and 8 bit integers as hex nunbers.

	- ip6tables requires '--icmpv6-type' rather than '--icmp-type'

	- ebtables complains about protocol identifiers lower than 0x600, so already discard anything lower than 0x600 in the parser

	- make the protocol entry types more readable using a #define for its entries

	- continue parsing a filtering rule even if a faulty entry is encountered; return an error value at the end and let the caller decide what to do with the rule's object

	- fix an error message

	Changes to clock timer XML to match final design.
	The clock timer XML is being updated in the following ways (based on
	further off-list discussion that was missed during the initial
	implementation):

	1) 'wallclock' is changed to 'track', and the possible values are 'boot'
	 (corresponds to old 'host'), 'guest', and 'wall'.

	2) 'mode' has an additional value 'smpsafe'

	3) when tickpolicy='catchup', there can be an optional sub-element of
	   timer called 'catchup':

	   <catchup threshold=123 slew=120 limit=10000/>

	Those three values are all longs, always optional, and if they are present,
	they are positive. Internally, 0 indicates "unspecified".

	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: updated RNG definition to account for changes

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: change the C struct and enums to match changes.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: timer parse and format functions changed to
	                          handle the new selections and new element.

	Allow domain disk images on root-squash NFS to coexist with security driver.
	(suggested by Daniel Berrange, tested by Dan Kenigsberg)

	virStorageFileGetMetadata will fail for disk images that are stored on
	a root-squash NFS share that isn't world-readable.
	SELinuxSetSecurityImageLabel is called during the startup of every
	domain (as long as security_driver != "none"), and it will propogate
	the error from virStorageFileGetMetadata, causing the domain startup
	to fail. This is, however, a common scenario when qemu is run as a
	non-root user and the disk image is stored on NFS.

	Ignoring this failure (which doesn't matter in this case, since the
	next thing done by SELinuxSetSecurityImageLabel - setting the file
	context - will also fail (and that function already ignores failures
	due to root-squash NFS) will allow us to continue bringing up the
	domain. The result is that we don't need to disable the entire
	security driver just because a domain's disk image is stored on
	root-squashed NFS.

	Don't use virFileReadLimFD in qemuDomainRestore.
	virFileReadLimFD is a poor fit for reading the header
	of the restore file.  The problem is that virFileReadLimFD
	returns an error when there is more data after the amount
	you ask to read, but that is *expected* in this case.

	This patch is essentially a revert of
	1a4d5c9543641c444dccd682f6256ee3faf22a80, but I don't think
	that commit does what it says anyway.  It purports to prevent
	an unwarranted OOM error, but since virFileReadLimFD will
	allocate memory up to the maximum anyway, the upper limit
	on the total amount of memory allocated is the same for either
	the old version or the new version.  Since the old saferead
	actually works and virFileReadLimFD does not, revert to
	using saferead.

	Keep track of guest paused state after disk IO / watchdog events
	When a watchdog/IO error occurs, one of the possible actions that

	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED

	with a detail being one of:

	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_IOERROR
	  VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_SUSPENDED_WATCHDOG

	To future proof against possible QEMU support for multiple monitor
	consoles, this patch also hooks into the 'STOPPED' event in QEMU

	While writing a couple of test cases for the nwfilter's XML parser I found some cases where the output ended up not looking as expected. So the following changes are in the patch below:
	- if the protocol ID in the MAC header is an integer, just write it into
	the datastructure without trying to find a corresponding string for it
	and if none is found failing
	- when writing the protocol ID as string, simply write it as integer if
	no corresponding string can be found
	- same changes for arpOpcode parsing and printing
	- same changes for protocol ID in an IP packet
	- DSCP value needs to be written into the data structure
	- IP protocol version number is redundant at this level, so remove it
	- parse the protocol ID found inside an IP packet not only as string but
	also as uint8
	- arrange the display of the src and destination masks to be shown after
	the src and destination ip address respectively in the XML
	- the existing libvirt IP address parser accepts for example '25' as an
	IP address. I want this to be parsed as a CIDR type netmask. So try to
	parse it as an integer first (CIDR netmask) and if that doesn't work as
	a dotted IP address style netmask.
	- instantiation of rules with MAC masks didn't work because they weren't
	printed into a buffer, yet.

	esx: Generate most SOAP mapping and improve inheritance handling
	The Python script generates the mappings based on the type descriptions
	in the esx_vi_generator.input file.

	This also improves the inheritance handling and allows to get rid of the
	ugly, inflexible, and error prone _base/_super approach. Now every struct
	that represents a SOAP type contains a _type member, that allows to
	recreate C++-like dynamic dispatch for "method" calls in C.

	A cosmetic change that makes the entries in the int-2-string maps look more readable. Add some missing entries: ipv6 and icmpv6.

2010-03-30  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	Use libvirt's existing ipv6/ipv4 parser/printer rather than self-written ones
	This patch changes the network filtering code to use libvirt's existing
	IPv4 and IPv6 address parsers/printers rather than my self-written ones.

	I am introducing a new function in network.c that counts the number of
	bits in a netmask and ensures that the given address is indeed a netmask,
	return -1 on error or values of 0-32 for IPv4 addresses and 0-128 for
	IPv6 addresses. I then based the function checking for valid netmask
	on invoking this function.

2010-03-30  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	Add ip6tables support for IPv6 filtering
	This patch adds IPv6 filtering support for the following protocols:
	- tcp-ipv6
	- udp-ipv6
	- udplite-ipv6
	- esp-ipv6
	- ah-ipv6
	- sctp-ipv6
	- all-ipv6
	- icmpv6

	Many of the IPv4 data structure could be re-used for IPv6 support.
	Since ip6tables also supports pretty much the same command line parameters
	as iptables does, also much of the code could be re-used and now
	command lines are invoked with the ip(6)tables tool parameter passed
	through the functions as a parameter.

2010-03-30  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	Remove driver dependency from nwfilter_conf.c
	This patch removes the driver dependency from nwfilter_conf.c and moves
	a callback function calling into the driver into
	nwfilter_gentech_driver.c and passes a pointer to that callback function
	upon initialization of nwfilter_conf.c.

	Add support for so-far missing protocols for iptables filtering
	This patch adds filtering support for the so-far missing protocols 'ah',
	'esp' and 'udplite'.

2010-03-30  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Implement the qemu-kvm backend of clock timer elements
	Since the timers are defined to cover all possible config cases for
	several different hypervisors, many of these possibilities generate an
	error on qemu. Here is what is currently supported:

	RTC: If the -rtc commandline option is available, allow setting
	"clock=host"
	     or "clock=vm" based on the rtc timer clock='host|guest' value. Also
	     add "driftfix=slew" if the tickpolicy is 'catchup', or add nothing
	if
	     tickpolicy is 'delay'. (Other tickpolicies will raise an error).

	     If -rtc isn't available, but -rtc-td-hack is, add that option
	     if the tickpolicy is 'catchup', add -rtc-td-hack, if it is 'delay'
	     add nothing, and if it's anything else, raise an error.

	PIT: If -no-kvm-pit-reinjection is available, and tickpolicy is
	     'delay', add that option. if tickpolicy is 'catchup', do
	     nothing. Anything else --> raise an error.

	     If -no-kvm-pit-reinjection *isn't* available, but -tdf is, when
	     tickpolicy is 'catchup' add -tdf. If it's 'delay', do
	     nothing. Anything else --> raise an error.

	     If neither of those commandline options is available, and
	     tickpolicy is anything other than 'delay' (or unspecified), raise
	     an error.

	HPET: If -no-hpet flag is available and present='no', add -no-hpet.
	      If -no-hpet is not available, and present='yes', raise an error.
	      If present is unspecified, the default is to do whatever this
	      particular qemu does by default, so don't raise an error.

	All other timer types are unsupported by QEMU, so they will raise an
	error.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: extend qemuBuildClockArgStr() to generate the
	  command line arguments for the new options

2010-03-30  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add flags to indicate presence of timekeeping-related qemu options
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: define 4 new flags
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: check the help text of qemu for presence of
	                        features indicated by each flag.
	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: add appropriate flags into the masks for each test

2010-03-30  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add timer element to domain schema
	timers are sub-elements of clocks. A clock can have zero or more
	instances of timer. Within the timer, only the name attribute is
	required; all other attributes are optional.

	A simpler representation of a timer element is:

	  <timer name='platform|pit|rtc|hpet|tsc'
	         wallclock='host|guest'
	         tickpolicy='delay|catchup|merge|discard'
	         frequency='123'
	         mode='auto|native|emulate|paravirt'
	         present='yes|no'/>

	frequency is a ulong. All other attributes are simple enums.

2010-03-30  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Implement XML parser/formatter for "timer" subelement of domain clock
	This extension is described in

	http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2010-March/msg00304.html

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: add data definition for virDomainTimerDef
	  and add a list of them to virDomainClockDef
	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: XML parser and formatter for a timer inside a clock
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: add new Timer enum helper functions to symbols

2010-03-30  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix QEMU cpu affinity at startup to include all threads
	The QEMU cpu affinity is used in NUMA scenarios to ensure that
	guest memory is allocated from a specific node. Normally memory
	is allocate on demand in vCPU threads, but when using hugepages
	the initial thread leader allocates memory upfront. libvirt was
	not setting affinity of the thread leader, or I/O threads. This
	patch changes the code to set the process affinity in between
	the fork()/exec() of QEMU. This ensures that every single QEMU
	thread gets the affinity

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Set affinity on entire QEMU process
	  at startup

	virsh: support VISUAL, and allow metacharacters in EDITOR
	Common Unix practice is to prefer VISUAL over EDITOR, particularly if
	the editor of choice spawns a new window.  Thus, it is also common to
	see settings like EDITOR='emacs -nw', with the expectation that the
	shell will parse this as an argument to 'emacs' and not try to invoke
	a file containing a space.

	If a user puts junk in EDITOR, they deserve what they get (much more
	than virsh will misbehave); furthermore, sudo scrubs EDITOR by
	default.  So the blind use of metacharacters in EDITOR should not be
	considered too much of a security issue.

	* tools/virsh.c (editFile): Prefer VISUAL over EDITOR.  Don't
	reject shell metacharacters in EDITOR.
	* tools/virsh.pod (edit, net-edit, ENVIRONMENT): Document VISUAL.
	Fixes https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=487738.

	Add script hook support to the LXC driver
	Right now this implements only 2 basic hooks:
	- before the lxc control process is being launched
	- after the lxc control process is terminated
	the XML description of the domain is passed to the hook script stdin
	/etc/libvirt/hook/lxc

	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: implement synchronous script hooks for LXC

2010-03-30  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Add script hook support to the QEmu driver
	Right now this implements only 2 basic hooks:
	- before the qemu process is being launched
	- after the qemu process is terminated
	the XML description of the domain is passed to the hook script stdin
	/etc/libvirt/hook/qemu

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: implement synchronous script hooks for QEmu
	  at domain startup and end

2010-03-30  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Add the script hook support to the libvirt daemon
	It supports 3 kind of probing times, at daemon startup, when the
	daemon reloads its drivers on SIGHUP and when the daemon exits

	* daemon/libvirtd.c: daemon hooks for startup, reload and exit

2010-03-30  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Add hook utilities
	This exports 3 basic routines:
	  - virHookInitialize() initializing the hook support by looking for
	    scripts availability
	  - virHookPresent() used to test if there is a hook for a given driver
	  - virHookCall() which actually calls a synchronous script hook with
	    the needed parameters
	Note that this doesn't expose any public API except for the locations
	and arguments passed to the scripts

	* src/Makefile.am: add the 2 new files
	* src/util/hooks.h src/util/hooks.c: implements the 3 functions
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the 3 symbols internally
	* po/POTFILES.in: add src/util/hooks.c to translatables modules

	Helper function for making a copy of virCPUDefPtr

2010-03-27  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	cpuUpdate() for updating guest CPU according to host CPU
	Useful mainly for migration. cpuUpdate changes guest CPU requirements in
	the following way:

	- match == "strict" || match == "exact"
	    - optional features which are supported by host CPU are changed into
	      required features
	    - optional features which are not supported by host CPU are disabled
	    - all other features remain untouched
	- match == "minimum"
	    - match is changed into "exact"
	    - optional features and all features not mentioned in guest CPU
	      specification which are supported by host CPU become required
	      features
	    - other optional features are disabled
	    - all other features remain untouched

	This ensures that no feature will suddenly disappear from the guest
	after migration.

2010-03-27  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Don't replace persistent domain config with migrated config
	When a domain is defined on host1, migrated to host2 and then migrated
	back to host1, its current configuration would overwrite the libvirtd's
	in-memory copy of persistent configuration of that domain. This is not
	desired as we want to preserve the persistent configuration untouched.

	This patch introduces new 'live' parameter to virDomainAssignDef.
	Passing 'true' for 'live' means the configuration passed to
	virDomainAssignDef describes a configuration of live instance of the
	domain. This applies for saved domains which are being restored or for
	incoming domains during migration.

	All callers have been changed to pass the appropriate value.

	Extensions for iptables rules
	This patch adds support for L3/L4 filtering using iptables. This adds

	As mentioned in the introduction, a .c file provided by this patch
	is #include'd into a .c file. This will need work, but should be alright
	for review.

2010-03-27  Stefan Berger  <stefanb@us.ibm.com>

	Add IPv6 support for the ebtables layer
	This patch adds IPv6 support for the ebtables layer. Since the parser
	etc. are all parameterized, it was fairly easy to add this...

	Add qemu support
	Add support for Qemu to have firewall rules applied and removed on VM
	startup and shutdown respectively. This  patch also provides support for
	the updating of a filter that causes all VMs that reference the filter
	to have their ebtables/iptables rules updated.

	Core driver implementation with ebtables support
	This patch implements the core driver and provides
	- management functionality for managing the filter XMLs
	- compiling the internal filter representation into ebtables rules
	- applying ebtables rules on a network (tap,macvtap) interface
	- tearing down ebtables rules that were applied on behalf of an
	interface
	- updating of filters while VMs are running and causing the firewalls to
	be rebuilt
	- other bits and pieces

	Add XML parser extensions for network filtering
	This patch adds XML processing for the network filter schema
	and extends the domain XML processing to parse the top level
	referenced filter along with potentially provided parameters

	Add virsh support for new CLI commands
	This patch adds virsh support for the five new CLI commands to manage
	network filters.

	Definition of the wire format, RPC client & server
	This patch adds the definition of the wire format for RPC calls
	and implementation of the RPC client & server code

	Implementation of the public API
	This patch adds the implementation of the public API for the network
	filtering (ACL) extensions to libvirt.c .

	Add internal API
	This patch adds the internal API extensions for network filtering (ACL) support.

	Add public API
	This patch adds extensions to libvirt's public API necessary for
	controlling the new functionality from remote for example.

	Add recursive locks
	This patch adds recursive locks necessary due to the processing of
	network filter XML that can reference other network filters, including
	references that cause looks. Loops in the XML are prevented but their
	detection requires recursive locks.

2010-03-27  David Allan  <dallan@redhat.com>

	Use enum of virDomainNetType
	To find out where the net type 'direct' needs to be handled I introduced
	the 'enum virDomainNetType' in the virDomainNetDef structure and let the
	compiler tell me where the case statement is missing. Then I added the
	unhandled device statement to the UML driver.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h: change _virDomainNetDef type from int to

	Introduce a new virDomainUpdateDeviceFlags public API
	The current virDomainAttachDevice API can be (ab)used to change
	the media of an existing CDROM/Floppy device. Going forward there
	will be more devices that can be configured on the fly and overloading

	Add domain events for graphics network clients
	This introduces a new event type

	   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_GRAPHICS

	The same event can be emitted in 3 scenarios

	  typedef enum {
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_CONNECT = 0,
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_INITIALIZE,
	      VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_GRAPHICS_DISCONNECT,
	  } virDomainEventGraphicsPhase;

	Connect/disconnect are triggered at socket accept/close.
	The initialize phase is immediately after the protocol
	setup and authentication has completed. ie when the
	client is authorized and about to start interacting with
	the graphical desktop

	This event comes with *a lot* of potential information

	 - IP address, port & address family of client
	 - IP address, port & address family of server
	 - Authentication scheme (arbitrary string)
	 - Authenticated subject identity. A subject may have
	   multiple identities with some authentication schemes.
	   For example, vencrypt+sasl results in a x509dname
	   and saslUsername identities.

	This results in a very complicated callback :-(

	Add support for an explicit guest reboot event
	The reboot event is not a normal lifecycle event, since the
	virtual machine on the host does not change state. Rather the
	guest OS is resetting the virtual CPUs. ie, the QEMU process
	does not restart. Thus, this does not belong in the current
	lifecycle events callback.

2010-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remote driver & daemon impl of new event API
	This wires up the remote driver to handle the new events APIs.
	The public API allows an application to request a callback filters
	events to a specific domain object, and register multiple callbacks
	for the same event type. On the wire there are two strategies for
	this

	 - Register multiple callbacks with the remote daemon, each
	   with filtering as needed
	 - Register only one callback per event type, with no filtering

	Both approaches have potential inefficiency. In the first scheme,
	the same event gets sent over the wire many times if multiple
	callbacks are registered. With the second scheme, unneccessary
	events get sent over the wire if a per-domain filter is set on
	the client. The second scheme is far easier to implement though,
	so this patch takes that approach.

	* daemon/dispatch.h: Don't export remoteRelayDomainEvent since it
	  is no longer needed for unregistering callbacks, instead the
	  unique callback ID is used
	* daemon/libvirtd.c, daemon/libvirtd.h: Track and unregister
	  callbacks based on callback ID, instead of function pointer
	* daemon/remote.c: Switch over to using virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny
	  instead of legacy virConnectDomainEventRegister function. Refactor
	  remoteDispatchDomainEventSend() to cope with arbitrary event types
	* src/driver.h, src/driver.c: Move verify() call into source file
	  instead of header, to avoid polluting the global namespace with
	  the verify function name
	* src/remote/remote_driver.c: Implement new APIs for event
	  registration. Refactor processCallDispatchMessage() to cope
	  with arbitrary incoming event types. Merge remoteDomainQueueEvent()
	  into processCallDispatchMessage() to avoid duplication of code.
	  Rename remoteDomainReadEvent() to remoteDomainReadEventLifecycle()
	* src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Define wire format for the new
	  virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny and virConnectDomainEventDeregisterAny
	  functions

	Add new internal domain events APIs for handling other event types
	The current internal domain events API tracks callbacks based on
	the function pointer, and only supports lifecycle events. This
	adds new internal APIs for registering callbacks for other event
	types. These new APIs are postfixed with the word 'ID' to indicate
	that they operated based on event ID, instead of hardcoded to
	lifecycle events

2010-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor domain events to handle multiple event types
	The internal domain events APIs are designed to handle the lifecycle
	events. This needs to be refactored to allow arbitrary new event
	types to be handled.

	 * The signature of virDomainEventDispatchFunc changes to use
	   virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback instead of the lifecycle
	   event specific virConnectDomainEventCallback
	 * Every registered callback gains a unique ID to allow its
	   removal based on ID, instead of function pointer
	 * Every registered callback gains an 'eventID' to allow callbacks
	   for different types of events to be distinguished
	 * virDomainEventDispatch is adapted to filter out callbacks
	   whose eventID does not match the eventID of the event being
	   dispatched
	 * virDomainEventDispatch is adapted to filter based on the
	   domain name and uuid, if this filter is set for a callback.
	 * virDomainEvent type/detail fields are moved into a union to
	   allow different data fields for other types of events to be
	   added later

	* src/conf/domain_event.h, src/conf/domain_event.c: Refactor
	  to allow handling of different types of events
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_driver.c, src/test/test_driver.c,

	  to use virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback

2010-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make internal domain events struct definitions private
	The virtual box driver was directly accesing the domain events
	structs instead of using the APIs provided. To prevent this kind
	of abuse, make the struct definitions private, forcing use of the
	internal APIs. This requires adding one extra internal API.

	* src/conf/domain_event.h, src/conf/domain_event.c: Move
	  virDomainEventCallback and virDomainEvent structs into
	  the source file instead of header
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: Use official APIs for dispatching domain
	  events instead of accessing structs directly.

2010-03-26  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce a new public API for domain events
	The current API for domain events has a number of problems

	 - Only allows for domain lifecycle change events
	 - Does not allow the same callback to be registered multiple times
	 - Does not allow filtering of events to a specific domain

	This introduces a new more general purpose domain events API

	  typedef enum {
	     VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE = 0,       /* virConnectDomainEventCallback */
	      ...more events later..
	  }

	  int virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                       virDomainPtr dom, /* Optional, to filter */
	                                       int eventID,
	                                       virConnectDomainEventGenericCallback cb,
	                                       void *opaque,
	                                       virFreeCallback freecb);

	  int virConnectDomainEventDeregisterAny(virConnectPtr conn,
	                                         int callbackID);

	Since different event types can received different data in the callback,
	the API is defined with a generic callback. Specific events will each
	have a custom signature for their callback. Thus when registering an
	event it is neccessary to cast the callback to the generic signature

	eg

	  int myDomainEventCallback(virConnectPtr conn,
	                            virDomainPtr dom,
	                            int event,
	                            int detail,
	                            void *opaque)
	  {
	    ...
	  }

	  virConnectDomainEventRegisterAny(conn, NULL,
	                                   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_ID_LIFECYCLE,
	                                   VIR_DOMAIN_EVENT_CALLBACK(myDomainEventCallback)
	                                   NULL, NULL);

	tests: Don't add extra padding if counter mod 40 is 0
	This change only affects the output of tests that have an exact
	multiple of 40 test cases. For example the domainschematest currently:

	TEST: domainschematest
	      ........................................ 40
	      ........................................ 80
	      ........................................ 120
	      ........................................ 160
	      ........................................                                         200 OK
	PASS: domainschematest

	It outputs additional 40 spaces on the last line.

	The domainschematest output is fixed by the change in test-lib.sh. The
	change in testutils.c fixes this for tests written in C. Currently no
	C test has an exact multiple of 40 test cases, but I checked it and
	the same problem exists there.

	This patch stops that in both cases.

	Allow suspend during live migration
	Currently no command can be sent to a qemu process while another job is
	active. This patch adds support for signaling long-running jobs (such as
	migration) so that other threads may request predefined operations to be
	done during such jobs. Two signals are defined so far:
	    - QEMU_JOB_SIGNAL_CANCEL
	    - QEMU_JOB_SIGNAL_SUSPEND

	The first one is used by qemuDomainAbortJob.

	The second one is used by qemudDomainSuspend for suspending a domain
	during migration, which allows for changing live migration into offline
	migration. However, there is a small issue in the way qemudDomainSuspend
	is currently implemented for migrating domains. The API calls returns
	immediately after signaling migration job which means it is asynchronous
	in this specific case.

	Fix hang in qemudDomainCoreDump.
	Currently if you dump the core of a qemu guest with
	qemudDomainCoreDump, subsequent commands will hang
	up libvirtd.  This is because qemudDomainCoreDump
	uses qemuDomainWaitForMigrationComplete, which expects
	the qemuDriverLock to be held when it's called.  This
	patch does the simple thing and moves the qemuDriveUnlock
	to the end of the qemudDomainCoreDump so that the driver
	lock is held for the entirety of the call (as it is done
	in qemudDomainSave).  We will probably want to make the
	lock more fine-grained than that in the future, but
	we can fix both qemudDomainCoreDump and qemudDomainSave
	at the same time.

	Make sure qemudDomainSetVcpus doesn't hang.
	The code to add job support into libvirtd caused a problem
	in qemudDomainSetVcpus.  In particular, a qemuDomainObjEndJob()
	call was added at the end of the function, but a
	corresponding qemuDomainObjBeginJob() was not.  Additionally,
	a call to qemuDomainObj{Enter,Exit}Monitor() was also missed
	in qemudDomainHotplugVcpus().  These missing calls conspired to
	cause a hang in the libvirtd process after the command was
	finished.  Fix this by adding the missing calls.

	Remove qemudDomainSetMaxMemory.

	error: Unable to change MaxMemorySize
	error: this function is not supported by the hypervisor: virDomainSetMaxMemory

	Get thread and socket information in virsh nodeinfo.
	The current code for "nodeinfo" is pretty naive
	about socket and thread information.  To determine the
	sockets, it just takes the number of cpus and divides
	by the number of cores.  For the thread count, it always
	sets it to 1.  With more recent Intel machines, however,
	hyperthreading is again an option, meaning that these
	heuristics no longer work and give bogus numbers.  This
	patch goes through /sys to get the additional
	information so we properly report it.

	Note that I had to edit the tests not to report on
	socket and thread counts, since these are determined
	dynamically now.

	Fix USB passthrough based on product/vendor
	Changeset

	  commit 5073aa994af460e775cb3e548528e28d7660fcc8
	  Author: Cole Robinson <crobinso@redhat.com>
	  Date:   Mon Jan 11 11:40:46 2010 -0500

	Added support for product/vendor based passthrough, but it only
	worked at the security driver layer. The main guest XML config
	was not updated with the resolved bus/device ID. When the QEMU
	argv refactoring removed use of product/vendor, this then broke
	launching guests.

	THe solution is to move the product/vendor resolution up a layer
	into the QEMU driver. So the first thing QEMU does is resolve
	the product/vendor to a bus/device and updates the XML config
	with this info. The rest of the code, including security drivers
	and QEMU argv generated can now rely on bus/device always being
	set.

	* src/util/hostusb.c, src/util/hostusb.h: Split vendor/product
	  resolution code out of usbGetDevice and into usbFindDevice.
	  Add accessors for bus/device ID
	* src/security/virt-aa-helper.c, src/security/security_selinux.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_security_dac.c: Remove vendor/product from the
	  usbGetDevice() calls
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use usbFindDevice to resolve vendor/product
	  into a bus/device ID

	Tweak container initialization to make upstart/init happier
	Upstart crashes & burns in a heap if $TERM environment variable
	is missing. Presumably the kernel always sets this when booting
	init on a real machine, so libvirt should set it for containers
	too.

	To make a typical inittab / mingetty setup happier, we need to
	symlink the primary console /dev/pts/0 to /dev/tty1.

	Misc fixes for LXC cgroups setup
	When using the 'ns' cgroup controller, the moment a process calls
	'unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)', it will be given a private cgroup tree
	under its current location. This really messages up the LXC
	controller process, because it ends up creating the containers'
	cgroup in the wrong place. The fix is fairly easy, just move
	the cgroup setup before the code which calls unshare(). The
	'ns' controller will still create extra undesired cgroups, but
	they at least won't break libvirt's setup now.

	The patch also adds a missing cgroups allow rule for /dev/tty
	device node

2010-03-05  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Avoid creating top level cgroups if just querying for existance
	When getting the driver/domain cgroup it is possible to specify

	Change default for storage uid/gid from getuid()/getgid() to -1/-1
	This allows the config to have a setting that means "leave it alone",
	eg when building a pool where the directory already exists the user
	may want the current uid/gid of the directory left intact. This
	actually gets us back to older behavior - before recent changes to the
	pool building code, we weren't as insistent about honoring the uid/gid
	settings in the XML, and virt-manager was taking advantage of this
	behavior.

	As a side benefit, removing calls to getuid/getgid from the XML
	parsing functions also seems like a good idea. And having a default
	that is different from a common/useful value (0 == root) is a good
	thing in general, as it removes ambiguity from decisions (at least one
	place in the code was checking for (perms.uid == 0) to see if a
	special uid was requested).

	Note that this will only affect newly created pools and volumes. Due
	to the way that the XML is parsed, then formatted for newly created
	volumes, all existing pools/volumes already have an explicit uid and
	gid set.

	src/conf/storage_conf.c: Remove calls to setuid/setgid for default values
	                         of uid/gid, and set them to -1 instead

	Support VCPU hotplug in QEMU guests
	QEMU has a monitor command 'set_cpu' which allows a specific
	CPU to be toggled between online& offline state. libvirt CPU
	hotplug does not work in terms of individual indexes CPUs.

	Make domain save work on root-squash NFS
	Move *all* file operations related to creation and writing of libvirt
	header to the domain save file into a hook function that is called by
	virFileOperation. First try to call virFileOperation as root. If that
	fails with EACCESS, and (in the case of Linux) statfs says that we're
	trying to save the file on an NFS share, rerun virFileOperation,
	telling it to fork a child process and setuid to the qemu user. This
	is the only way we can successfully create a file on a root-squashed
	NFS server.

	This patch (along with setting dynamic_ownership=0 in qemu.conf)
	makes qemudDomainSave work on root-squashed NFS.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: provide new qemudDomainSaveFileOpHook()
	  utility, use it in qemudDomainSave() if normal creation of the
	  file as root failed, and after checking the filesystem type for
	  the storage is NFS. In that case we also bypass the security

	Fix domain restore for files on root-squash NFS
	If qemudDomainRestore fails to open the domain save file, create a

	file, then reads this file and stuffs it into the pipe. the parent
	libvirtd process will use the other end of the pipe as its fd, then
	reap the child process after it's done reading.

	This makes domain restore work on a root-squash NFS share that is only
	visible to the qemu user.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: add new qemudOpenAsUID() helper function,
	  and use it in qemudDomainRestore() if reading as root directly failed.

	Introduce public API for cancelling async domain jobs
	The new virDomainAbortJob() method provides a way for a second
	thread to abort an ongoing job run by another thread. This
	extends to any API with  which the virDomainGetJobInfo() API
	is intended to work. Cancellation is not guarenteed, rather best
	effort on part of the hypervisor and not required to be implmented.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Define virDomainAbortJob()

2010-03-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Add QEMU driver support for job info on migration ops
	Introduce support for  virDomainGetJobInfo in the QEMU driver. This
	allows for monitoring of any API that uses the 'info migrate' monitor
	command. ie virDomainMigrate, virDomainSave and virDomainCoreDump

	Unfortunately QEMU does not provide a way to monitor incoming migration
	so we can't wire up virDomainRestore yet.

	The virsh tool gets a new command 'domjobinfo' to query status

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Record virDomainJobInfo and start time

	Fix PCI address handling when controllers are deleted
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: in qemudDomainDetachPciControllerDevice()
	  when a controller is not present in the system anymore, the PCI
	  address must be deleted from libvirt's hashtable because it can
	  be re-used for other purposes.

	Fix data structure handling when controllers are attached
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: in qemudDomainAttachDevice(), one must not
	  delete the data part when the operation succeeds because it is
	  required later on. The correct pattern to handlethe parsed
	  representation of the device information on success
	  is dev->data.controller = NULL; virDomainDeviceDefFree(dev);,
	  which leaves the structure pointed at by data in memory.

	Support variable clock offset mode in QEMU
	This allows QEMU guests to be started with an arbitrary clock

	remote: Improve daemon startup error reporting
	If I toggle enable_tcp in libvirtd.conf and add --listen in
	/etc/init.d/libvirtd, I get the unhelpful error:

	Starting libvirtd daemon: error: Unable to initialize network sockets.

	Running without --daemon provides much more useful info:

	sudo libvirtd --listen
	11:29:26.117: error : remoteCheckCertFile:270 : Cannot access CA certificate '/etc/pki/CA/cacert.pem': No such file or directory

	The daemon architecture makes it difficult to report this useful

2010-02-25  Richard Jones  <rjones@redhat.com>

	Ignore SIGWINCH in remote client call to poll(2) (RHBZ#567931).
	In bug 567931 we found that virt-top would exit occasionally
	when the terminal window was resized.  Tracking this down it
	turned out that SIGWINCH was being delivered to the process at
	exactly the point where the libvirt remote driver was calling
	poll(2) waiting for a reply from libvirtd.

	This caused the poll(2) call to be interrupted (returning errno
	EINTR).  However handling EINTR the same way as EAGAIN was not
	the solution to this problem since we found previously that this
	would break Ctrl-C handling (commit 47fec8eac2bb3).

	The correct solution is to mask out SIGWINCH for the duration
	of the poll(2) system call.  The per-thread mask is changed and
	restored immediately after the call.  Since we are using
	pthread_sigmask, this should not affect other threads, and
	since we restore the signal mask immediately afterwards it should
	not affect the current thread visibly either.  Other possibly
	problematic signals are SIGCHLD and SIGPIPE and these are
	masked too.

	Note use of ignore_value: It's not fatal if we cannot mask out
	SIGWINCH, and in any case pthread_sigmask never fails on Linux
	as long as you supply the correct arguments.

	I tested this patch and it cures the original problem with
	virt-top.

	Fix daemon-conf invalid failures
	The daemon-conf test would fail on my system if there was a system libvirtd
	running.  In the course of troubleshooting that problem, I discovered that the
	daemon-conf script would always fail if run by itself because it found the line:

	\# that each "PARAMETER = VALUE" line in this file have the parameter

	which it mistook for a line containing a parameter.  I have changed the test to
	avoid mistaking a line containing \"PARAMETER = VALUE\" for a parameter line.

	The corrupted config tests turned out to be failing because the test daemon was
	discovering the pid file from the running daemon and exiting before it processed
	the test config file.  Specifying the pid file for the corrupt config tests in
	the same way as for the valid config test solved that problem.

2010-02-20  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Use virFileOperation hook function in virStorageBackendFileSystemVolBuild
	There were a few operations on the storage volume file that were still
	being done as root, which will fail if the file is on a root-squashed
	NFS share. The result was that attempts to create a storage volume of
	type "raw" on a root-squashed NFS share would fail.

	This patch uses the newly introduced "hook" function in
	virFileOperation to execute all those file operations in the child
	process that's run under the uid that owns the file (and, presumably,
	has permission to write to the NFS share)

	* src/storage/storage_backend.c: use virFileOperation() in
	  virStorageBackendCreateRaw, turning virStorageBackendCreateRaw()
	  into a new createRawFileOpHook() hook

2010-02-20  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Rename virFileCreate to virFileOperation, add hook function
	It turns out it is also useful to be able to perform other operations
	on a file created while running as a different uid (eg, write things
	to that file), and possibly to do this to a file that already
	exists. This patch adds an optional hook function to the renamed (for
	more accuracy of purpose) virFileOperation; the hook will be called
	after the file has been opened (possibly created) and gid/mode
	checked/set, before closing it.

	As with the other operations on the file, if the VIR_FILE_OP_AS_UID
	flag is set, this hook function will be called in the context of a
	child process forked from the process that called virFileOperation.
	The implication here is that, while all data in memory is available to
	this hook function, any modification to that data will not be seen by
	the caller - the only indication in memory of what happened in the
	hook will be the return value (which the hook should set to 0 on
	success, or one of the standard errno values on failure).

	Another piece of making the function more flexible was to add an
	"openflags" argument. This arg should contain exactly the flags to be
	passed to open(2), eg O_RDWR | O_EXCL, etc.

	In the process of adding the hook to virFileOperation, I also realized
	that the bits to fix up file owner/group/mode settings after creation
	were being done in the parent process, which could fail, so I moved
	them to the child process where they should be.

	* src/util/util.[ch]: rename and rework virFileCreate-->virFileOperation,
	  and redo flags in virDirCreate
	* storage/storage_backend.c, storage/storage_backend_fs.c: update the
	  calls to virFileOperation/virDirCreate to reflect changes in the API,
	  but don't yet take advantage of the hook.

	macvtap IFF_VNET_HDR configuration

	Use virFork() in __virExec(), virFileCreate() and virDirCreate()
	For __virExec() this is a semantic NOP except for when fork()
	fails. __virExec() would previously forget to restore the signal mask
	in this case; virFork() corrects this behavior.

	virFileCreate() and virDirCreate() gain the code to reset the logging
	and properly deal with the signal handling race condition.

	This also removes a log message that had a typo ("cannot fork o create
	file '%s'") - this error is now logged in a more generic manner in
	virFork() (more generic, but really just as informative, since the
	fact that it's forking to create a file is immaterial to the fact that
	it simply can't fork)

	* src/util/util.c: use the generic virFork() in the 3 functions

2010-02-19  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add virFork() function to utils
	virFork() contains bookkeeping that must be done any time a process
	forks. Currently this includes:

	1) Call virLogLock() prior to fork() and virLogUnlock() just after,
	   to avoid a deadlock if some other thread happens to hold that lock
	   during the fork.

	2) Reset the logging hooks and send all child process log messages to
	   stderr.

	3) Block all signals prior to fork(), then either a) reset the signal
	   mask for the parent process, or b) clear the signal mask for the
	   child process.

	Note that the signal mask handling in __virExec erroneously fails to
	restore the signal mask when fork() fails. virFork() fixes this
	problem.

	Other than this, it attempts to behave as closely to fork() as
	possible (including preserving errno for the caller), with a couple
	exceptions:

	1) The return value is 0 (success) or -1 (failure), while the pid is
	   returned via the pid_t* argument. Like fork(), if pid < 0 there is
	   no child process, otherwise both the child and the parent will
	   return to the caller, and both should look at the return value,
	   which will indicate if some of the extra processing outlined above
	   encountered an error.

	2) If virFork() returns with pid < 0 or with a return value < 0
	   indicating an error condition, the error has already been
	   reported. You can log an additional message if you like, but it
	   isn't necessary, and may be awkwardly extraneous.

	Note that virFork()'s child process will *never* call _exit() - if a
	child process is created, it will return to the caller.

	* util.c util.h: add virFork() function, based on what is currently
	                 done in __virExec().

	macvtap teardown rework
	Rework and simplification of teardown of the macvtap device.

	Basically all devices with the same MAC address and link device are kept
	alive and not attempted to be torn down. If a macvtap device linked to a
	physical interface with a certain MAC address 'M' is to be created it
	will automatically fail if the interface is 'up'ed and another macvtap
	with the same properties (MAC addr 'M', link dev) happens to be 'up'.
	This will prevent the VM from starting or the device from being attached
	to a running VM. Stale interfaces are assumed to be there for some
	reason and not stem from libvirt.

	In the VM shutdown path, it's assuming that an interface name is always
	available so that if the device type is DIRECT it can be torn down
	using its name.

	interface: Use proper return codes in the open function
	The open function returned -1 in case of an error, but -1 maps

	Convert virSecurityReportError into a macro
	The virRaiseError macro inside of virSecurityReportError expands to
	virRaiseErrorFull and includes the __FILE__, __FUNCTION__ and __LINE__
	information. But this three values are always the same for every call
	to virSecurityReportError and do not reflect the actual error context.

	Converting virSecurityReportError into a macro results in getting the
	correct __FILE__, __FUNCTION__ and __LINE__ information.

	Add persistence of PCI addresses to QEMU
	Current PCI addresses are allocated at time of VM startup.
	To make them truely persistent, it is neccessary to do this
	at time of virDomainDefine/virDomainCreate. The code in
	qemuStartVMDaemon still remains in order to cope with upgrades
	from older libvirt releases

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Rename existing qemuAssignPCIAddresses
	  to qemuDetectPCIAddresses. Add new qemuAssignPCIAddresses which
	  does auto-allocation upfront. Call qemuAssignPCIAddresses from

	Fix <cpu> element in domain XML schema
	The current schema is more permissive than the XML parsing code in

	reality its use is bound to <model> element:

	- <cpu> element without 'match' attribute is allowed only if <topology>
	  element is the only child element of <cpu>

	- <cpu> element with 'match' attribute requires <model> element to be

	Fix disk stats retrieval with QEMU >= 0.12
	With QEMU >= 0.12 the host and guest side of disks no longer have
	the same naming convention. Specifically the host side will now
	get a 'drive-' prefix added to its name. The 'info blockstats'
	monitor command returns the host side name, so it is neccessary
	to strip this off when looking up stats since libvirt stores the
	guest side name !

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Move 'drive-' prefix
	  string to a defined constant
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c: Strip
	  off 'drive-' prefix (if found) when looking up disk stats

	qemu: Increase guest startup timeout to 30 seconds
	Currently the timeout for reading startup output is 3 seconds. If the
	host is under any sort of load, we can easily trigger this. Lets bump
	it to 30 seconds.

	Since the polling loop checks to see if the process has died, we shouldn't
	erroneously hit this timeout if qemu bombs (only if it is stuck in some
	infinite loop).

	Fix log locking problem when using fork() in the library
	Ad pointed out by Dan Berrange:
	So if some thread in libvirtd is currently executing a logging call,
	while another thread calls virExec(), that other thread no longer
	exists in the child, but its lock is never released. So when the
	child then does virLogReset() it deadlocks.

	The only way I see to address this, is for the parent process to call
	virLogLock(), immediately before fork(), and then virLogUnlock()
	afterwards in both parent & child. This will ensure that no other
	thread
	can be holding the lock across fork().

	* src/util/logging.[ch] src/libvirt_private.syms: export virLogLock() and

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Re-arrange QEMU device alias assignment code
	This patch re-arranges the QEMU device alias assignment code to
	make it easier to call into the same codeblock when performing
	device hotplug. The new code has the ability to skip over already
	assigned names to facilitate hotplug

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Call qemuAssignDeviceNetAlias()
	  instead of qemuAssignNetNames
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Export qemuAssignDeviceNetAlias()
	  instead of qemuAssignNetNames
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Merge the legacy disk/network alias
	  assignment code into the main methods

	Remove direct storage of hostnet_name & vlan
	The current way of assigning names to the host network backend and
	NIC device in QEMU was over complicated, by varying naming scheme
	based on the NIC model and backend type. This simplifies the naming
	to simply be 'net0' and 'hostnet0', allowing code to easily determine
	the host network name and vlan based off the primary device alias
	name 'net0'. This in turn allows removal of alot of QEMU specific
	code from the XML parser, and makes it easier to assign new unique
	names for NICs that are hotplugged

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Remove hostnet_name
	  and vlan fields from virNetworkDefPtr
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu/qemu_driver.c:
	  Use a single network alias naming scheme regardless of NIC type
	  or backend type. Determine VLANs from the alias name.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-eth-names.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-device.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.args: Update
	  for new simpler naming scheme

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove use of -netdev arg with QEMU
	The QEMU 0.12.x tree has the -netdev command line argument, but not
	corresponding monitor command. We can't enable the former, without
	the latter since it will break hotplug/unplug.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Disable -netdev usage
	  until 0.13 at earliest
	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Add test for -netdev syntax
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-net-virtio-netdev.xml: Test
	  data files for -netdev syntax

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Assign PCI addresses before hotplugging devices
	PCI disk, disk controllers, net devices and host devices need to
	have PCI addresses assigned before they are hot-plugged

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Add APIs for ensuring a device has an
	  address and releasing unused addresses
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Ensure all devices have addresses
	  when hotplugging.

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rewrite way QEMU PCI addresses are allocated
	The current QEMU code allocates PCI addresses incrementally starting
	at 4. This is not satisfactory because the user may have given some
	addresses in their XML config, which need to be skipped over when
	allocating addresses to remaining devices.

	It is thus neccessary to maintain a list of already allocated PCI
	addresses and then only allocate ones that remain unused. This is
	also required for domain device hotplug to work properly later.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Add APIs for creating
	  list of existing PCI addresses, and allocating new addresses.
	  Refactor address assignment to use this code
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pull PCI address assignment up into the
	  qemuStartVMDaemon() method, as a prelude to moving it into the
	  'define' method. Update list of allocated addresses when connecting
	  to a running VM at daemon startup.
	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c, tests/qemuargv2xmltest.c,
	  tests/qemuxml2xmltest.c: Remove USB product test since all
	  passthrough is done based on address
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-usb-product.args,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-hostdev-usb-product.xml: Kil
	  unused data files

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce generic virDomainDeviceInfo iterator function
	The virDomainDeviceInfoIterate() function will provide a
	convenient way to iterate over all devices in a domain.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDeviceInfoIterate()
	  function.

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make hotplug use new device_add where possible
	Since QEMU startup uses the new -device argument, the hotplug
	code needs todo the same. This converts disk, network and
	host device hotplug to use the device_add command

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Use new device_add monitor APIs
	  whereever possible

2010-02-03  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce internal QEMU monitor APIs for drive + device hotadd
	The way QEMU is started has been changed to use '-device' and
	the new style '-drive' syntax. This needs to be mirrored in
	the hotplug code, requiring addition of two new APIs.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Define APIs
	  qemuMonitorAddDevice() and qemuMonitorAddDrive()
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h:
	  Implement the new monitor APIs

2010-02-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split out QEMU code for building PCI/USB hostdev arg values
	To allow for better code reuse from hotplug methods, the code for
	generating PCI/USB hostdev arg values is split out into separate
	methods

	* qemu/qemu_conf.h, qemu/qemu_conf.c: Introduce new APis for
	  qemuBuildPCIHostdevPCIDevStr, qemuBuildUSBHostdevUsbDevStr
	  and qemuBuildUSBHostdevDevStr

2010-02-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Standard internal API syntax for building QEMU command line arguments
	All the helper functions for building command line arguments
	now return a 'char *', instead of acepting a 'char **' or
	virBufferPtr argument

	* qemu/qemu_conf.c: Standardize syntax for building args
	* qemu/qemu_conf.h: Export all functions for building args
	* qemu/qemu_driver.c: Update for changed syntax for building
	  NIC/hostnet args

	libvirtd.c: avoid closing a negative socket file descriptor
	* daemon/libvirtd.c (qemudListenUnix): Close socket only if non-negative.

	storage_backend.c: avoid closing a negative file descriptor

2010-02-02  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	udev: Don't let strtoul parse USB busnum and devnum as octal
	udevGetUintProperty was called with base set to 0 for busnum and devnum.
	With base 0 strtoul parses the number as octal if it start with a 0. But
	busnum and devnum are decimal and udev returns them padded with leading
	zeros. So strtoul parses them as octal. This works for certain decimal
	values like 001-007, but fails for values like 008.

	Change udevProcessUSBDevice to use base 10 for busnum and devnum.

2010-02-02  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	util.c (two more): don't use a negative value as allocation size
	* src/util/util.c (virGetUserID, virGetGroupID): In the unlikely event
	that sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) fails, don't use -1 as the size in
	the subsequent allocation.

	json.c: avoid an unconditional leak from most qemuMonitorJSON* functions
	* src/util/json.c (virJSONValueFree): Free the "value" pointer, too.

	avoid format-related warnings
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c (qemuMonitorTextGetAllPCIAddresses):
	Use %s.
	* src/storage/storage_backend_iscsi.c (virStorageBackendCreateIfaceIQN):
	Likewise.
	* tools/virsh.c (cmdSecretSetValue): Likewise.

2010-02-02  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	redundant parenthesis.

2010-02-01  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix PCI host reattach on domain detach.
	Similar to the race fixed by
	be34c3c7efbb1ea8999530f98b99c5dde3793f84, make sure
	to wait around for KVM to release the resources from
	a hot-detached PCI device before attempting to
	rebind that device to the host driver.

2010-02-01  Matthew Booth  <mbooth@redhat.com>

	Clarify controllers -device string in QEMU driver
	The QEMU driver contained code to generate a -device string for piix4-ide, but
	wasn't using it. This change removes this string generation. It also adds a
	comment explaining why IDE and FDC controllers don't generate -device strings.

	The change also generates an error if a sata controller is specified for a QEMU
	domain, as this isn't supported.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Remove VIR_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER_TYPE_IDE handler in
	  qemuBuildControllerDevStr(). Ignore IDE and FDC controllers. Error if
	  SATA controller is discovered. Add comments.

2010-02-01  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up a comment in virHashUpdateEntry

2010-02-01  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Look in /usr/libexec for the qemu-kvm binary.
	On RHEL-5 the qemu-kvm binary is located in /usr/libexec.
	To reduce confusion for people trying to run upstream libvirt
	on RHEL-5 machines, make the qemu driver look in /usr/libexec
	for the qemu-kvm binary.

	To make this work, I modified virFindFileInPath to handle an
	absolute path correctly.  I also ran into an issue where
	NULL was sometimes being passed for the file parameter
	to virFindFileInPath; it didn't crash prior to this patch
	since it was building paths like /usr/bin/(null).  This
	is non-standard behavior, though, so I added a NULL
	check at the beginning.

2010-01-30  Eric Blake  <ebb9@byu.net>

	maint: fix spelling error in hacking
	* HACKING: STRCASEEQ is case insensitive.

	util.c (virGetUserEnt): don't use a negative value as allocation size
	* src/util/util.c (virGetUserEnt): In the unlikely event that
	sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) fails, don't use -1 as the size in
	the subsequent allocation.

2010-01-28  Jim Fehlig  <jfehlig@novell.com>

	Support Xen 4.0 sysctl version 7
	xen-unstable c/s 20762 bumped XEN_SYSCTL_INTERFACE_VERSION to 7.  The
	interface change does not affect libvirt, other than xenHypervisorInit()
	failing since version 7 is not tried.

	The attached patch accommodates the upcoming Xen 4.0 release by checking
	for XEN_SYSCTL_INTERFACE_VERSION 7.  If found, it sets
	XEN_DOMCTL_INTERFACE_VERSION to 6, which is also new to Xen 4.0.

	when "models" is NULL and nmodels is 1 or greater.

	portability to non-glibc: don't use realpath(..., NULL)
	it causes a NULL-dereference on some systems like Solaris 10.
	* src/node_device/node_device_linux_sysfs.c. Include <stdlib.h>.
	(get_sriov_function): Use canonicalize_file_name, not realpath.
	* bootstrap (modules): Add canonicalize-lgpl.

2010-01-26  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Cleanup of large buffer on stack in virFileMakePath
	virFileMakePath is a recursive function that was creates a buffer
	PATH_MAX bytes long for each recursion (one recursion for each element
	in the path). This changes it to have no buffers on the stack, and to
	allocate just one buffer total, no matter how many elements are in the
	path. Because the modified algorithm requires a char* to be passed in
	rather than const char *, it is now 2 functions - a toplevel API
	function that remains identical in function, and a 2nd helper function
	called for the recursions, which 1) doesn't allocate anything, and 2)
	takes a char* arg, so it can modify the contents.
	* src/util/util.c: rewrite virFileMakePath

	Revert "Fix libvirtd restart for domains with PCI passthrough devices"
	This reverts commit cdc42d0a4865199a941d330dbb6ca1ef426323ae.
	As DanB pointed out, this patch is actually wrong.  The real
	bug that was causing me to see this problem is a bug
	introduced in a RHEL-5 libvirt snapshot, and I'm going to
	fix the real bug there.

2010-01-26  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix a crash when restarting libvirtd.
	If you shutdown libvirtd while a domain with PCI
	devices is running, then try to restart libvirtd,
	libvirtd will crash.

	This happens because qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs() is calling
	pciDeviceListSteal() with a dev of 0x0 (NULL), and then trying
	to dereference it.  This patch fixes it up so that
	qemuUpdateActivePciHostdevs() steals the devices after first
	Get()'ting them, avoiding the crash.

	qemuMonitorTextAttachDrive: avoid two leaks
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c (qemuMonitorTextAttachDrive): Most other
	failures in this function would "goto cleanup", but one mistakenly
	returned directly, skipping the cleanup and resulting in a leak.
	In addition, iterating the "try_command" loop would clobber, and
	thus leak, the "cmd" allocated on the first iteration,
	so be careful to free it in addition to "reply" beforehand.

	qemu: Fix race between device rebind and kvm cleanup
	Certain hypervisors (like qemu/kvm) map the PCI bar(s) on
	the host when doing device passthrough.  This can lead to a race
	condition where the hypervisor is still cleaning up the device while
	libvirt is trying to re-attach it to the host device driver.  To avoid
	this situation, we look through /proc/iomem, and if the hypervisor is
	still holding onto the bar (denoted by the string in the matcher variable),
	then we can wait around a bit for that to clear up.

	v2: Thanks to review by DV, make sure we wait the full timeout per-device

2010-01-22  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix device assignment with root devices
	The patches to add ACS checking to PCI device passthrough
	introduced a bug.  With the current code, if you try to
	passthrough a device on the root bus (i.e. bus 0), then
	it denies the passthrough.  This is because the code in
	pciDeviceIsBehindSwitchLackingACS() to check for a parent
	device doesn't take into account the possibility of the
	root bus.  If we are on the root bus, it means we
	legitimately can't find a parent, and it also means that
	we don't have to worry about whether ACS is enabled.
	Therefore return 0 (indicating we don't lack ACS) from
	pciDeviceIsBehindSwitchLackingACS().

	Fix security driver calls in hotplug cleanup paths
	The hotplug code was not correctly invoking the security driver
	in error paths. If a hotplug attempt failed, the device would
	be left with VM permissions applied, rather than restored to the
	original permissions. Also, a CDROM media that is ejected was
	not restored to original permissions. Finally there was a bogus
	call to set hostdev permissions in the hostdev unplug code

2010-01-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix leak of allocated security label
	If a VM fails to start, we can't simply free the security label
	strings, we must call the domainReleaseSecurityLabel() method
	otherwise the reserved 'mcs' level will be leaked in SElinux

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Invoke domainReleaseSecurityLabel()
	  when domain fails to start

2010-01-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor setup & cleanup of security labels in security driver
	The current security driver architecture has the following
	split of logic

	 * domainGenSecurityLabel

	    Allocate the unique label for the domain about to be started

	 * domainGetSecurityLabel

	    Retrieve the current live security label for a process

	 * domainSetSecurityLabel

	    Apply the previously allocated label to the current process
	    Setup all disk image / device labelling

	 * domainRestoreSecurityLabel

	    Restore the original disk image / device labelling.
	    Release the unique label for the domain

	The 'domainSetSecurityLabel' method is special because it runs
	in the context of the child process between the fork + exec.

	This is require in order to set the process label. It is not
	required in order to label disks/devices though. Having the
	disk labelling code run in the child process limits what it
	can do.

	In particularly libvirtd would like to remember the current
	disk image label, and only change shared image labels for the
	first VM to start. This requires use & update of global state
	in the libvirtd daemon, and thus cannot run in the child
	process context.

	The solution is to split domainSetSecurityLabel into two parts,
	one applies process label, and the other handles disk image
	labelling. At the same time domainRestoreSecurityLabel is
	similarly split, just so that it matches the style. Thus the
	previous 4 methods are replaced by the following 6 new methods

	 * domainGenSecurityLabel

	    Allocate the unique label for the domain about to be started
	    No actual change here.

	 * domainReleaseSecurityLabel

	   Release the unique label for the domain

	 * domainGetSecurityProcessLabel

	   Retrieve the current live security label for a process
	   Merely renamed for clarity.

	 * domainSetSecurityProcessLabel

	   Apply the previously allocated label to the current process

	 * domainRestoreSecurityAllLabel

	    Restore the original disk image / device labelling.

	 * domainSetSecurityAllLabel

	    Setup all disk image / device labelling

	The SELinux and AppArmour drivers are then updated to comply with
	this new spec. Notice that the AppArmour driver was actually a
	little different. It was creating its profile for the disk image
	and device labels in the 'domainGenSecurityLabel' method, where as
	the SELinux driver did it in 'domainSetSecurityLabel'. With the
	new method split, we can have consistency, with both drivers doing
	that in the domainSetSecurityAllLabel method.

	NB, the AppArmour changes here haven't been compiled so may not
	build.

2010-01-21  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make security drivers responsible for checking dynamic vs static labelling
	The QEMU driver is doing 90% of the calls to check for static vs
	dynamic labelling. Except it is forgetting todo so in many places,
	in particular hotplug is mistakenly assigning disk labels. Move
	all this logic into the security drivers themselves, so the HV
	drivers don't have to think about it.

	* src/security/security_driver.h: Add virDomainObjPtr parameter
	  to virSecurityDomainRestoreHostdevLabel and to
	  virSecurityDomainRestoreSavedStateLabel
	* src/security/security_selinux.c, src/security/security_apparmor.c:

	Create storage pool directories with proper uid/gid/mode
	Previously the uid/gid/mode in the xml was ignored when creating new
	storage pool directories. This commit attempts to honor the requested
	permissions, and spits out an error if it can't.

	Note that when creating the directory, the rest of the path leading up
	to the final element is created using current uid/gid/mode, and the
	final element gets the settings from xml. It is NOT an error for the
	directory to already exist; in this case, the perms for the existing
	directory are just set (if necessary).

	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c: update the virStorageBackendFileSystemBuild
	  function to check the directory hierarchy separately then create the
	  leaf directory with the right attributes

2010-01-21  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Create storage volumes directly with desired uid/gid
	In order to avoid problems trying to chown files that were created by
	root on a root-squashing nfs server, fork a new process that setuid's
	to the desired uid before creating the file. (It's only done this way
	if the pool containing the new volume is of type 'netfs', otherwise
	the old method of creating the file followed by chown() is used.)

	This changes the semantics of the "create_func" slightly - previously
	it was assumed that this function just created the file, then the
	caller would chown it to the desired uid. Now, create_func does both
	operations.

	There are multiple functions that can take on the role of create_func:

	createFileDir - previously called mkdir(), now calls virDirCreate().
	virStorageBackendCreateRaw - previously called open(),
	                             now calls virFileCreate().
	virStorageBackendCreateQemuImg - use virRunWithHook() to setuid/gid.
	virStorageBackendCreateQcowCreate - same.
	virStorageBackendCreateBlockFrom - preserve old behavior (but attempt
	                                   chown when necessary even if not root)

	* src/storage/storage_backend.[ch] src/storage/storage_backend_disk.c
	  src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c src/storage/storage_backend_logical.c
	  src/storage/storage_driver.c: change the create_func implementations,
	  also propagate the pool information to be able to detect NETFS ones.

2010-01-21  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	New utility functions virFileCreate and virDirCreate
	These functions create a new file or directory with the given
	uid/gid. If the flag VIR_FILE_CREATE_AS_UID is given, they do this by
	forking a new process, calling setuid/setgid in the new process, and
	then creating the file. This is better than simply calling open then
	fchown, because in the latter case, a root-squashing nfs server would
	create the new file as user nobody, then refuse to allow fchown.

	If VIR_FILE_CREATE_AS_UID is not specified, the simpler tactic of
	creating the file/dir, then chowning is is used. This gives better
	results in cases where the parent directory isn't on a root-squashing
	NFS server, but doesn't give permission for the specified uid/gid to
	create files. (Note that if the fork/setuid method fails to create the
	file due to access privileges, the parent process will make a second
	attempt using this simpler method.)

	If the bit VIR_FILE_CREATE_ALLOW_EXIST is set in the flags, an
	existing file/directory will not cause an error; in this case, the
	function will simply set the permissions of the file/directory to
	those requested. If VIR_FILE_CREATE_ALLOW_EXIST is not specified, an
	existing file/directory is considered (and reported as) an error.

	Return from both of these functions is 0 on success, or the value of
	errno if there was a failure.

2010-01-21  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add virRunWithHook util function

	Make all bitfields unsigned ints to avoid unexpected values in casts
	The 'int virInterfaceIsActive()' method was directly returning the
	value of the 'int active:1' bitfield in virIntefaceDefPtr. A bitfield
	with a signed integer, will hold the values 0 and -1, not 0 and +1
	as might be expected. This meant that virInterfaceIsActive() was
	always returning -1 when the interface was active, not +1 & thus all
	callers thought an error had occurred. To protect against this kind
	of mistake again, change all bitfields to be unsigned ints

	Update interface.rng and xml test files to match netcf 0.1.5
	The RNG now supports IPv6 and bonds attached to bridges, along with
	some other minor tweaks. All test files from netcf have been copied to
	the test directory and added to the xml2xml and schema tests (and they
	all pass, of course ;-)

2010-01-20  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Support bond interfaces attached to bridges in interface xml.
	This was accomplished in xml parsing by doing away with the
	stripped-down virInterfaceBareDef object, and just always using
	virInterfaceDef, but with restrictions in certain places (eg, the type
	of subordinate interface allowed in parsing depends on the parent
	interface).

	xml formatting was similarly adjusted. In addition, the formatting
	functions keep track of the level of interface nesting, and insert
	extra leading spaces on each line accordingly (using %*s).

	The only change in formatted xml from previous (aside frmo supporting
	new combinations of interface types) is that the subordinate ethernet
	interfaces take up 2 lines rather than one, eg:

	   <interface type='ethernet' name='eth0'>
	   </interface>

	instead of:

	   <interface type='ethernet' name='eth0'/>

	Add Jiri Denemark <jdenemar@redhat.com> to commiters

2010-01-19  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Allow for CPU topology specification without model
	Currently CPU topology may only be specified together with CPU model:
	    <cpu match='exact'>
	        <model>name</model>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2' threads='3'/>
	    </cpu>

	This patch allows for CPU topology specification without the need for
	also specifying CPU model:
	    <cpu>
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2' threads='3'/>
	    </cpu>

	'match' attribute and 'model' element are made optional with the

	Take disabled/forced CPU features into account
	When comparing x86 CPUs, features with 'disabled' policy were mistakenly
	required to be supported by the host CPU.

	Likewise, features with 'force' policy which were supported by host CPU

	This patch fixes both issues.

2010-01-19  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Implement CPU topology support for QEMU driver
	QEMU's command line equivalent for the following domain XML fragment
	    <vcpus>2</vcpus>
	    <cpu ...>
	        ...
	        <topology sockets='1' cores='2', threads='1'/>
	    </cpu>

	is

	    -smp 2,sockets=1,cores=2,threads=1

	This syntax was introduced in QEMU-0.12.

	Version 2 changes:
	- -smp argument build split into a separate function
	- always add ",sockets=S,cores=C,threads=T" to -smp if qemu supports it
	- use qemuParseCommandLineKeywords for command line parsing

	Version 3 changes:
	- ADD_ARG_LIT => ADD_ARG and line reordering in qemudBuildCommandLine
	- rebased

2010-01-19  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Enhance qemuParseCommandLineKeywords
	Current version expects name=value,... list and when an incorrect string
	such as "a,b,c=d" would be parsed as "a,b,c" keyword with "d" value
	without reporting any error, which is probably not the expected
	behavior.

	This patch adds an extra argument called allowEmptyValue, which if
	non-zero will permit keywords with no value; "a,b=c,,d=" will be parsed
	as follows:
	    keyword value
	    "a"     NULL
	    "b"     "c"
	    ""      NULL
	    "d"     ""

	In case allowEmptyValue is zero, the string is required to contain
	name=value pairs only; retvalues is guaranteed to contain non-NULL
	pointers. Now, "a,b,c=d" will result in an error.

	Convert USB input devices to -device

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert USB hostdevices over to -device
	The old syntax was

	   -usbdevice host:PRODUCT:VENDOR

	Or

	   -usbdevice host:BUS.DEV

	The new syntax is

	   -device usb-host,product=PRODUCT,vendor=VENDOR

	Or

	   -device usb-host,hostbus=BUS,hostaddr=DEV

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert USB disks over to -device
	The previous syntax was severely limited in its options

	  -usbdevice disk:/home/berrange/output.img

	The new syntax is the same as for other disk types

	  -drive file=/home/berrange/output.img,if=none,id=usb-1,index=1
	  -device usb-storage,drive=usb-1

	Again, the index= arg is wrong here, and will be removed in a
	later merge

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert NICs over to use -device & -netdev where possible
	The current syntax uses a pair of args

	   -net nic,macaddr=52:54:00:56:6c:55,vlan=3,model=pcnet,name=pcnet.0
	   -net user,vlan=3,name=user.0

	The new syntax does not  need the vlan craziness anymore, and
	so has a simplified pair of args

	   -netdev user,id=user.0
	   -device pcnet,netdev=user.0,id=pcnet.0,mac=52:54:00:56:6c:55,addr=<PCI SLOT>

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert disk drive over to use -device where available
	The current preferred syntax for disk drives uses

	  -drive file=/vms/plain.qcow,if=virtio,index=0,boot=on,format=qcow

	The new syntax splits this up into a pair of linked args

	  -drive file=/vms/plain.qcow,if=none,id=drive-virtio-0,format=qcow2
	  -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=drive-virtio-0,id=virtio-0,addr=<PCI SLOT>

	SCSI/IDE devices also get a bus property linking them to the
	controller

	  -device scsi-disk,drive=drive-scsi0-0-0,id=scsi0-0-0,bus=scsi0.0,scsi-id=0
	  -device ide-drive,drive=drive-ide0-0-0,id=ide0-0-0,bus=ide0,unit=0

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert audio devices over to -device syntax
	The current syntax for audio devices is a horrible multiplexed
	arg

	    -soundhw sb16,pcspk,ac97

	The new syntax is

	    -device sb16,id=sound0

	or

	    -device AC97,id=sound1,addr=<PCI SLOT>

	NB, pcspk still uses the old -soundhw syntax

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert watchdog to -device
	The current syntax for watchdogs is

	    -watchdog i6300esb

	The new syntax will now be

	    -device i6300esb,id=watchdogNN,addr=<PCI-SLOT>

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Convert character devices over to use -device
	The current character device syntax uses either

	  -serial tty,path=/dev/ttyS2

	Or

	  -chardev tty,id=serial0,path=/dev/ttyS2 -serial chardev:serial0

	With the new -device support, we now prefer

	  -chardev file,id=serial0,path=/tmp/serial.log -device isa-serial,chardev=serial0

	This patch changes the existing -chardev syntax to use this new
	scheme, and fallbacks to the old plain -serial syntax for old
	QEMU.

	The monitor device changes to

	  -chardev socket,id=monitor,path=/tmp/test-monitor,server,nowait -mon chardev=monitor

	In addition, this patch adds --nodefaults, which kills off the
	default serial, parallel, vga and nic devices. THis avoids the
	need for us to explicitly turn each off

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Assign device aliases for all devices at startup
	When starting a guest, give every device a unique alias. This will
	be used for the 'id' parameter in -device args in later patches.
	It can also be used to uniquely identify devices in the monitor

	For old QEMU without -device, assign disk names based on QEMU's
	historical naming scheme.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Assign unique device aliases
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Remove obsolete qemudDiskDeviceName
	  and use the device alias in eject & blockstats commands

	storage_backend_fs.c: do not ignore probe failure
	* src/storage/storage_backend_fs.c (virStorageBackendFileSystemRefresh):
	Correct parentheses.  The documented intent is to ignore non-regular

	that way.

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Probe for -device and use -nodefaults
	Probe for the new -device flag and if available set the -nodefaults
	flag, instead of using -net none, -serial none or -parallel none.
	Other device types will be converted to use -device in later patches.
	The -nodefaults flag will help avoid unwelcome surprises from future
	QEMU releases

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Probe for -device. Add -nodefaults flag.
	  Remove -net none, -serial none or -parallel none

	Add device info to serial, parallel, channel, input & fs devices
	Although the serial, parallel, chanel, input & fs devices do
	not have PCI address info, they can all have device aliases.
	Thus it neccessary to associate the virDomainDeviceInfo data
	with them all.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add hooks for
	  parsing / formatting device info for serial, parallel, channel
	  input and fs devices.
	* docs/schemas/domain.rng: Associate device info with character
	  devices, input & fs device

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Introduce device aliases
	This patch introduces the support for giving all devices a short,
	unique name, henceforth known as a 'device alias'.  These aliases
	are not set by the end user, instead being assigned by the hypervisor
	if it decides it want to support this concept.

	The QEMU driver sets them whenever using the -device arg syntax
	and uses them for improved hotplug/hotunplug. it is the intent
	that other APIs (block / interface stats & device hotplug) be
	able to accept device alias names in the future.

	The XML syntax is

	   <alias name="video0"/>

	This may appear in any type of device that supports device info.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Add a 'alias'
	  field to virDomainDeviceInfo struct & parse/format it in XML
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virDomainDefClearDeviceAliases
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Replace use of "nic_name" field with the
	  standard device alias
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Clear device aliases at shutdown

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Clear assigned PCI devices at shutdown
	The PCI device addresses are only valid while the VM is running,
	since they are auto-assigned by QEMU. After shutdown they must
	all be cleared. Future QEMU driver enhancement will allow for
	persistent PCI address assignment

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/libvirt_private.syms
	  Add virDomainDefClearPCIAddresses() method for wiping out auto assigned
	  PCI addresses
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Clear PCI addresses at VM shutdown

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Auto-add disk controllers based on defined disks
	Existing applications using libvirt are not aware of the disk
	controller concept. Thus, after parsing the <disk> definitions
	in the XML, it is neccessary to create <controller> elements
	to satisfy all requested disks, as per their defined drive
	addresses

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h,
	  src/libvirt_private.syms: Add virDomainDefAddDiskControllers()
	  method for populating disk controllers, and call it after
	  parsing disk definitions.
	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Call virDomainDefAddDiskControllers()
	  when doing ARGV -> XML conversion
	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv*.xml: Add disk controller
	  data to all data files which don't have it already

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove restriction on duplicated sound devices in parser
	It is perfectly acceptable to have multiple sound devices of
	same type in guest configuration. If the underlying hypervisor
	does not like this, it is its job to complain, not the XML
	parser's

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Remove hack which deleted duplicated
	  sound device models.
	* tests/xml2sexprdata/xml2sexpr-fv-sound.xml: Remove duplicate
	  models

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Detect PCI addresses at QEMU startup
	Hotunplug of devices requires that we know their PCI address. Even
	hotplug of SCSI drives, required that we know the PCI address of
	the SCSI controller to attach the drive to. We can find this out
	by running 'info pci' and then correlating the vendor/product IDs
	with the devices we booted with.

	Although this approach is somewhat fragile, it is the only viable
	option with QEMU < 0.12, since there is no way for libvirto set
	explicit PCI addresses when creating devices in the first place.
	For QEMU > 0.12, this code will not be used.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Assign all dynamic PCI addresses on
	  startup of QEMU VM, matching vendor/product IDs
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_json.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor_text.h: Add
	  API for fetching PCI device address mapping

2010-01-18  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Properly support SCSI drive hotplug
	The current SCSI hotplug support attaches a brand new SCSI controller
	for every disk. This is broken because the semantics differ from those
	used when starting the VM initially. In the latter case, each SCSI
	controller is filled before a new one is added.

	If the user specifies an high drive index (sdazz) then at initial
	startup, many intermediate SCSI controllers may be added with no
	drives.

	This patch changes SCSI hotplug so that it exactly matches the
	behaviour of initial startup. First the SCSI controller number is
	determined for the drive to be hotplugged. If any controller upto
	and including that controller number is not yet present, it is
	attached. Then finally the drive is attached to the last controller.

	NB, this breaks SCSI hotunplug, because there is no 'drive_del'
	command in current QEMU. Previous SCSI hotunplug was broken in
	any case because it was unplugging the entire controller, not
	just the drive in question.

	A future QEMU will allow proper SCSI hotunplug of a drive.

	This patch is derived from work done by Wolfgang Mauerer on disk
	controllers.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Fix SCSI hotplug to add a drive to
	 the correct controller, instead of just attaching a new
	  controller.
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h,

	  support for 'drive_add' command

2010-01-18  Wolfgang Mauerer  <wolfgang.mauerer@siemens.com>

	Implement SCSI controller hotplug/unplug for QEMU
	This patch allows for explicit hotplug/unplug of SCSI controllers.
	Ordinarily this is not required, since QEMU/libvirt will attach
	a new SCSI controller whenever one is required. Allowing explicit
	hotplug of controllers though, enables the caller to specify a
	static PCI address, instead of auto-assigning the next available
	PCI slot. Or it will when we have static PCI addressing.

	This patch is derived from Wolfgang Mauerer's disk controller
	patch series.

2010-01-18  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Use closest CPU model when decoding from CPUID
	Current implementation of x86Decode() used for CPUID -> model+features
	translation does not always select the closest CPU model. When walking
	through all models from cpu_map.xml the function considers a new
	candidate as a better choice than a previously selected candidate only
	if the new one is a superset of the old one. In case the new candidate
	is closer to host CPU but lacks some feature comparing to the old
	candidate, the function does not choose well.

	This patch changes the algorithm so that the closest model is always
	selected. That is, the model which requires the lowest number of
	additional features to describe host CPU.

2010-01-18  Diego Elio Pettenò  <flameeyes@gmail.com>

	Change detection of xen so that it's actually automatic rather than forced.
	This ensures that ./configure will work fine if xen development packages
	are not around, rather than fail. When passing ./configure --with-xen, the
	lack of xen development packages become fatal.

2010-01-18  Diego Elio Pettenò  <flameeyes@gmail.com>

	Standardise ./configure --help options reporting.
	Always use AC_HELP_STRING for the help text for options at ./configure,
	so that the output is properly aligned.

	Use proper quadrigraphs for outputting the brackets.

	Always use autoconf-style [default=$foo] output to state the default, both
	where it was stated before and where it wasn't.

	This time, include Matthias Bolte notes regarding defaults, and removing
	PFX specification from phyp.

	qemu: Use log output for pty assignment if 'info chardev' is unavailable
	qemudFindCharDevicePTYsMonitor reports an error if 'info chardev' didn't
	provide information for a requested device, even if the log output parsing
	had found the pty path for that device. This makes pty assignment fail for
	older QEMU/KVM versions. For example KVM 72 on Debian doesn't support
	'info chardev', so qemuMonitorTextGetPtyPaths cannot parse any useful
	information and the hash for device-id-to-pty-path mapping stays empty.

	Make qemudFindCharDevicePTYsMonitor report an error only if the log output
	parsing and the 'info chardev' parsing failed to provide the pty path.

	Specify bus/unit instead of index for disks with QEMU
	The current code for using -drive simply sets the -drive 'index'
	parameter. QEMU internally converts this to bus/unit depending
	on the type of drive. This does not give us precise control over
	the bus/unit assignment though. This change switches over to make
	libvirt explicitly calculate the bus/unit number.

	In addition bus/unit/index are actually irrelevant for VirtIO
	disks, since each virtio disk is a separate PCI device. No disk
	controller is involved.

	Doing the conversion to bus/unit in libvirt allows us to correctly
	attach SCSI controllers when required.

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.c: Specify bus/unit instead of index for

2010-01-16  Wolfgang Mauerer  <wolfgang.mauerer@siemens.com>

	Add new domain device: "controller"
	This augments virDomainDevice with a <controller> element
	that is used to represent disk controllers (e.g., scsi
	controllers). The XML format is given by

	  <controller type="scsi" index="<num>">
	     <address type="pci" domain="0xNUM" bus="0xNUM" slot="0xNUM"/>
	  </controller>

	where type denotes the disk interface (scsi, ide,...), index
	is an integer that identifies the controller for association
	with disks, and the <address> element specifies the controller
	address on the PCI bus as described in previous commits
	The address element can be omitted; in this case, an address
	will be assigned automatically.

	Most of the code in this patch is from Wolfgang Mauerer's
	previous disk controller series

	 * docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define syntax for <controller>
	   XML element
	 * src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/conf/domain_conf.h: Define

2010-01-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Set default disk controller/bus/unit props
	When parsing the <disk> element specification, if no <address>
	is provided for the disk, then automatically assign one based on

	allowing new apps to have complete fine grained control.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c,

	Implement path lookup for USB by vendor:product
	Based off how QEMU does it, look through /sys/bus/usb/devices/* for
	matching vendor:product info, and if found, use info from the surrounding
	files to build the device's /dev/bus/usb path.

	This fixes USB device assignment by vendor:product when running qemu
	as non-root (well, it should, but for some reason I couldn't reproduce

	node_device: udev: Use base 16 for product/vendor

	Fortunately, testing has revealed that xend will fail the

	Ensure error handling callback functions are called from safe context
	The virRaiseErrorFull() may invoke the error handler callback
	functions an application has registered. This is not good
	because the connection object may not be available at this
	point, and the caller may be holding locks. This creates a
	problem if the error handler calls back into libvirt.

	The solutuon is to move invocation of the handler into the
	final cleanup code in the public API entry points, where it
	is guarenteed to have safe state.

	* src/libvirt.c: Invoke virDispatchError() in all error paths
	* src/util/virterror.c: Remove virSetConnError/virSetGlobalError,

	esx: Fix 'vpx' MAC address range and allow arbitrary MAC addresses
	The MAC addresses with 00:50:56 prefix are split into several ranges:

	  00:50:56:00:00:00 - 00:50:56:3f:ff:ff  'static' range (manually assigned)
	  00:50:56:80:00:00 - 00:50:56:bf:ff:ff  'vpx' range (assigned by a VI Client)

	Erroneously the 'vpx' range was assumed to be larger and to occupy the
	remaining addresses of the 00:50:56 prefix that are not part of the 'static'
	range.

	00:50:56 was used as prefix for generated MAC addresses, this is not possible
	anymore, because there are gaps in the allowed ranges. Therefore, change the
	prefix to 00:0c:29 which is the prefix for auto generated MAC addresses anyway.

	Allow arbitrary MAC addresses to be used and set the checkMACAddress VMX option
	to false in case the MAC address doesn't fall into any predefined range.

	* docs/drvesx.html.in: update website accordingly

	esx: Don't warn about an empty URI path

	esx: Also allow virtualHW version 4 for ESX 4.0
	A domain with virtualHW version 4 is allowed on an ESX 4.0 server.
	If a domain is migrated from an ESX 3.5 server to an ESX 4.0 server
	then the virtualHW version stays the same. So a ESX 4.0 server can
	host domains with virtualHW version 4.

	Make Xen VT-d PCI attach/detach work
	The Xen code for making HVM VT-d PCI passthrough attach and detach
	wasn't working properly:

	1)  In xenDaemonAttachDevice(), we were always trying to reconfigure
	a PCI passthrough device, even the first time we added it.  This was
	because the code in virDomainXMLDevID() was not checking xenstore for
	the existence of the device, and always returning 0 (meaning that
	the device already existed).

	2)  In xenDaemonDetachDevice(), we were trying to use "device_destroy"
	to detach a PCI device.  While you would think that is the right
	method to call, it's actually wrong for PCI devices.  In particular,
	in upstream Xen (and soon in RHEL-5 Xen), device_configure is actually
	used to destroy a PCI device.

	To fix the attach
	problem I add a lookup into xenstore to see if the device we are
	trying to attach already exists.  To fix the detach problem I change
	it so that for PCI detach (only), we use device_configure with the
	appropriate sxpr to do the detachment.

	* src/xen/xend_internal.c: don't use device_destroy for PCI devices
	  and fix the other issues.

	Fix reporting of TLS connection errors
	The code for connecting to a server tries each socket in turn

	python: Add python bindings for virDomainMemoryStats
	Enable virDomainMemoryStats in the python API.  dom.memoryStats() will return a

	because the meaining of each quantity cannot be inferred from its index in a
	list.

	* python/generator.py: reenable bindings for this entry point
	* python/libvirt-override-api.xml python/libvirt-override.c: the

	  and the XML description

2009-12-20  Adam Litke  <agl@us.ibm.com>

	Add a new command dommemstats for virDomainMemoryStats
	Define a new command 'dommemstats' to report domain memory statistics.  The
	output format is inspired by 'domblkstat' and 'domifstat' and consists of
	tag/value pairs, one per line.  The command can complete successfully and
	print no output if virDomainMemoryStats is supported by the driver, but not
	the guest operating system.

	Sample output:
	swap_in 0
	swap_out 0
	major_fault 54
	minor_fault 58259
	unused 487680
	available 502472

	esx: Add more links to external documentation

	esx: Destroy virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	If a virtual machine is destroyed on a ESX server then immediately
	undefining this virtual machine on a vCenter may fail, because the
	vCenter has not been informed about the status change yet. Therefore,
	destroy a virtual machine on a vCenter if available, so the vCenter
	is up-to-date when the virtual machine should be undefined.

	esx: Undefine virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	Undefining a virtual machine on an ESX server leaves a orphan on the
	vCenter behind. So undefine a virtual machine on a vCenter if available
	to fix this problem.

	* configure.in: If you pass libraries in the LDFLAGS variable, and then

	Don't make it possible to define HAVE_HAL but not enable it in automake
	* configure.in: With the previous logic, if libhal_get_all_devices

	* src/cpu/cpu_map.xml: newdescription file

2009-12-18  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Adds CPU selection infrastructure
	Each driver supporting CPU selection must fill in host CPU capabilities.
	When filling them, drivers for hypervisors running on the same node as
	libvirtd can use cpuNodeData() to obtain raw CPU data. Other drivers,
	such as VMware, need to implement their own way of getting such data.
	Raw data can be decoded into virCPUDefPtr using cpuDecode() function.

	When implementing virConnectCompareCPU(), a hypervisor driver can just
	call cpuCompareXML() function with host CPU capabilities.

	For each guest for which a driver supports selecting CPU models, it must
	set the appropriate feature in guest's capabilities:

	    virCapabilitiesAddGuestFeature(guest, "cpuselection", 1, 0)

	Actions needed when a domain is being created depend on whether the
	hypervisor understands raw CPU data (currently CPUID for i686, x86_64
	architectures) or symbolic names has to be used.

	Typical use by hypervisors which prefer CPUID (such as VMware and Xen):

	- convert guest CPU configuration from domain's XML into a set of raw
	  data structures each representing one of the feature policies:

	    cpuEncode(conn, architecture, guest_cpu_config,
	              &forced_data, &required_data, &optional_data,
	              &disabled_data, &forbidden_data)

	- create a mask or whatever the hypervisor expects to see and pass it
	  to the hypervisor

	Typical use by hypervisors with symbolic model names (such as QEMU):

	- get raw CPU data for a computed guest CPU:

	    cpuGuestData(conn, host_cpu, guest_cpu_config, &data)

	- decode raw data into virCPUDefPtr with a possible restriction on
	  allowed model names:

	    cpuDecode(conn, guest, data, n_allowed_models, allowed_models)

	- pass guest->model and guest->features to the hypervisor

	XML schema for CPU flags
	XML schema for CPU flags

	Firstly, CPU topology and model with optional features have to be
	advertised in host capabilities:

	    <host>
	        <cpu>
	            <arch>ARCHITECTURE</arch>
	            <features>
	                <!-- old-style features are here -->
	            </features>
	            <model>NAME</model>
	            <topology sockets="S" cores="C" threads="T"/>
	            <feature name="NAME"/>
	        </cpu>
	        ...
	    </host>

	Secondly, drivers which support detailed CPU specification have to
	advertise
	it in guest capabilities:

	    <guest>
	    ...
	    <features>
	            <cpuselection/>
	        </features>
	    </guest>

	And finally, CPU may be configured in domain XML configuration:

	<domain>
	    ...
	    <cpu match="MATCH">
	        <model>NAME</model>
	        <topology sockets="S" cores="C" threads="T"/>
	        <feature policy="POLICY" name="NAME"/>
	    </cpu>
	</domain>

	Where MATCH can be one of:
	    - 'minimum'     specified CPU is the minimum requested CPU
	    - 'exact'       disable all additional features provided by host CPU
	    - 'strict'      fail if host CPU doesn't exactly match

	POLICY can be one of:
	    - 'force'       turn on the feature, even if host doesn't have it
	    - 'require'     fail if host doesn't have the feature
	    - 'optional'    match host
	    - 'disable'     turn off the feature, even if host has it
	    - 'forbid'      fail if host has the feature

	'force' and 'disable' policies turn on/off the feature regardless of its
	availability on host. 'force' is unlikely to be used but its there for
	completeness since Xen and VMWare allow it.

	'require' and 'forbid' policies prevent a guest from being started on a host
	which doesn't/does have the feature. 'forbid' is for cases where you disable
	the feature but a guest may still try to access it anyway and you don't want
	it to succeed.

	'optional' policy sets the feature according to its availability on host.
	When a guest is booted on a host that has the feature and then migrated to
	another host, the policy changes to 'require' as we can't take the feature
	away from a running guest.

	Default policy for features provided by host CPU but not specified in domain
	configuration is set using match attribute of cpu tag. If 'minimum' match is
	requested, additional features will be treated as if they were specified
	with 'optional' policy. 'exact' match implies 'disable' policy and 'strict'
	match stands for 'forbid' policy.

	  RelaxNG schemas to add CPU flags support

	Initialize gcrypt threading
	GNUTLS uses gcrypt for its crypto functions. gcrypt requires
	that the app/library initializes threading before using it.
	We don't want to force apps using libvirt to know about

	behalf. This location also ensures libvirtd has initialized
	it correctly. This initialization is required even if libvirt
	itself were only using one thread, since another non-libvirt

	thread

	Fix install location for Python bindings
	Commit 66137344feb488ea87b0d92f3c03844d9a7a7786 changed the Python detection

	After this commit they are installed to

	  /usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages

	Mixed Python packages (containing *.py and *.so files) should be installed to
	the pyexecdir directory detected by AM_PATH_PYTHON.

	Get QEMU pty paths from the monitor
	This change makes the QEMU driver get pty paths from the output of the
	monitor 'info chardev' command. This output is structured, and contains
	both the name of the device and the path on the same line. This is
	considerably more reliable than parsing the startup log output, which
	requires the parsing code to know which order QEMU will print pty
	information in.

	Note that we still need to parse the log output as the monitor itself
	may be on a pty. This should be rare, however, and the new code will
	replace all pty paths parsed by the log output method once the monitor
	is available.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.(c|h) src/qemu_monitor_text.(c|h): Implement
	  qemuMonitorGetPtyPaths().

	retrieve paused/running state at migration start
	This patch fixes the bug where paused/running state is not

	In order to do so, just read the state and if it is appropriate and

	remove iptablesReloadRules() and related code
	We don't use this method of reloading rules anymore, so we can just
	kill the code.

	This simplifies things a lot because we no longer need to keep a
	table of the rules we've added.

	* src/util/iptables.c: kill iptablesReloadRules()

2009-12-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	remove all traces of lokkit support
	Long ago we tried to use Fedora's lokkit utility in order to register
	our iptables rules so that 'service iptables restart' would
	automatically load our rules.

	There was one fatal flaw - if the user had configured iptables without
	lokkit, then we would clobber that configuration by running lokkit.

	We quickly disabled lokkit support, but never removed it. Let's do
	that now.

	The 'my virtual network stops working when I restart iptables' still
	remains. For all the background on this saga, see:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/227011

	* src/util/iptables.c: remove lokkit support

	* configure.in: remove --enable-lokkit

	* libvirt.spec.in: remove the dirs used only for saving rules for lokkit

	* src/Makefile.am: ditto

	* src/libvirt_private.syms, src/network/bridge_driver.c,
	  src/util/iptables.h: remove references to iptablesSaveRules

2009-12-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	reload iptables rules on libvirtd restart
	This is the expected behaviour, I think - reloading libvirtd should
	be a subset of restarting it.

	Note, we reload the rules after we've determined which networks
	are active (because we only add the rules for active networks)
	and before we start autostart networks (to avoid re-adding the
	rules).

	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: reload iptables rules on startup

2009-12-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	reload iptables rules simply by re-adding them
	Currently, when we add iptables rules, we keep them on a list so that
	we can easily reload them on e.g. 'service libvirtd reload'.

	However, we don't save this list to disk, so if libvirtd is restarted
	we lose the ability to reload the rules.

	The fix is simple - just re-add the damn things on reload.

	Note, we delete the rules before re-adding them, just like the current
	behaviour of iptRulesReload().

	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: re-add the iptables rules on reload.

	Make QEMU text monitor parsing more robust
	The QEMU 0.10.0 release (and possibly other 0.10.x) has a bug where
	it sometimes/often forgets to display the initial monitor greeting
	line, soley printing a (qemu).  This in turn confuses the text
	console parsing because it has a '(qemu)' it is not expecting. The
	confusion results in a negative malloc. Bad things follow.

	This re-writes the text console handling to be more robust. The key
	idea is that it should only look for a (qemu), once it has seen the
	original command echo'd back. This ensures it'll skip the bogus stray
	(qemu) with broken QEMUs.

	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c: Add some (disabled) debug code

	Fix virDomainObj ref handling in QEMU driver
	Since the monitor I/O is processed out of band from the main
	thread(s) invoking monitor  commands, the virDomainObj may be
	deleted by the I/O thread. The qemuDomainObjBeginJob takes an
	extra reference to protect against final deletion, but this
	reference is released by the corresponding EndJob call. THus
	after the EndJob call it may not be valid to reference the
	virDomainObj any more. To allow callers to detect this, the
	EndJob call is changed to return the remaining reference count.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c: Make virDomainObjUnref return the
	  remaining reference count
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Avoid referencing virDomainObjPtr
	  after qemuDomainObjEndJob if it has been deleted.

	Use AM_PATH_PYTHON and python-config to detect Python configuration
	Using AM_PATH_PYTHON solves the site-packages directory problem. At least
	in Ubuntu with Python 2.6 and later site-packages is renamed to dist-packages
	and site-packages is not part of sys.path anymore. So installing the libvirt
	Python bindings to site-packages renders them unusable, because they can be
	imported from there without manually including site-packages into sys.path.

	AM_PATH_PYTHON detects the correct site-packages/dist-packages directory.

	python-config --includes gives the correct include path for the Python header
	files. The old probing code stays there as fallback mechanism.

	* configure.in: use AM_PATH_PYTHON and python-config

	vbox: Use virIndexToDiskName() in vboxGenerateMediumName()

2009-12-05  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Tests for interface type/model configuration
	add a set of tests for Xen interface type and model configurations

2009-12-04  Jiri Denemark  <jdenemar@redhat.com>

	Support for interface model='netfront'
	Xen HVM guests with PV drivers end up with two network interfaces for
	each configured interface. One of them being emulated by qemu and the
	other one paravirtual. As this might not be desirable, the attached
	patch provides a way for users to specify that only paravirtual network
	interface should be presented to the guest.

	The configuration was inspired by qemu/kvm driver, for which users can
	specify model='virtio' to use paravirtual network interface.

	The patch adds support for model='netfront' which results in
	type=netfront instead of type=ioemu (or nothing for newer xen versions)
	in guests native configuration. Xen's qemu ignores interfaces with
	type != ioemu and only paravirtual network device will be seen in the
	guest.

	Four possible configuration scenarios follow:

	- no model specified in domain's XML
	    - libvirt will behave like before this change; it will set
	      type=ioemu for HVM guests on xen host which is not newer than
	      XEND_CONFIG_MAX_VERS_NET_TYPE_IOEMU
	    - covered by existing tests

	- PV guest, any model
	    - no functional change, model is passed as is (and ignored by the
	      hypervisor)
	    - covered by existing tests (e.g., *-net-e1000.*)
	- HVM guest, model=netfront
	    - type is set to "netfront", model is not specified
	    - covered by new *-net-netfront.* tests

	- HVM guest, model != netfront
	    - type is set to "ioemu", model is passed as is
	    - covered by new *-net-ioemu.* tests

	The fourth scenario feels like a regression for xen newer than
	XEND_CONFIG_MAX_VERS_NET_TYPE_IOEMU as users who had a model specified
	in their guest's configuration won't see a paravirtual interface in
	their guests any more. On the other hand, the reason for specifying a
	model is most likely the fact that they want to use such model which
	implies emulated interface. Users of older xen won't be affected at all
	as their xen provides paravirtual interface regardless of the type used.

	Add virIndexToDiskName and fix mapping gap
	esxVMX_IndexToDiskName handles indices up to 701. This limit comes
	from a mapping gap in virDiskNameToIndex:

	  sdzy -> 700
	  sdzz -> 701
	  sdaaa -> 728
	  sdaab -> 729

	This line in virDiskNameToIndex causes this gap:

	  idx = (idx + i) * 26;

	Fixing it by altering this line to:

	  idx = (idx + (i < 1 ? 0 : 1)) * 26;

	Also add a new version of virIndexToDiskName that handles the inverse
	mapping for arbitrary indices.

	* src/esx/esx_vmx.[ch]: remove esxVMX_IndexToDiskName

	Fix event test timer checks on kernels with HZ=100
	On kernels with HZ=100, the resolution of sleeps in poll() is
	quite bad. Doing a precise check on the expiry time vs the
	current time will thus often thing the timer has not expired
	even though we're within 10ms of the expected expiry time. This
	then causes another pointless sleep in poll() for <10ms. Timers
	do not need to have such precise expiration, so we treat a timer
	as expired if it is within 20ms of the expected expiry time. This
	also fixes the eventtest.c test suite on kernels with HZ=100

	Remove capng_lock() call when spawning LXC container init process
	The capng_lock() call sets the SECURE_NO_SETUID_FIXUP and SECURE_NOROOT
	bits on the process. This prevents the kernel granting capabilities to
	processes with an effective UID of 0, or with setuid programs. This is
	not actually what we want in the container init process. It should be
	allowed to run setuid processes & keep capabilities when root. All that
	is required is masking a handful of dangerous capabilities from the
	bounding set.

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c: Remove bogus capng_lock() call.

	Fix virt-aa-helper when host and os.type arch differ
	* src/security/virt-aa-helper.c: get_definition() now calls the new
	  caps_mockup() function which will parse the XML for os.type,
	  os.type.arch and then sets the wordsize.  These attributes are needed
	  only to get a valid virCapsPtr for virDomainDefParseString(). The -H

	Allow timeouts waiting for QEMU job lock
	Some monitor commands may take a very long time to complete. It is
	not desirable to block other incoming API calls forever. With this
	change, if an existing API call is holding the job lock, additional
	API calls will not wait forever. They will time out after a short
	period of time, allowing application to retry later.

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/util/virterror.c: Add new
	  VIR_ERR_OPERATION_TIMEOUT error code
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Change to a timed condition variable
	  wait for acquiring the monitor job lock

2009-11-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Release driver and domain lock when running monitor commands
	QEMU monitor commands may sleep for a prolonged period of time.
	If the virDomainObjPtr or qemu driver lock is held this will
	needlessly block execution of many other API calls. it also
	prevents asynchronous monitor events from being dispatched
	while a monitor command is executing, because deadlock will
	ensure.

	To resolve this, it is neccessary to release all locks while
	executing a monitor command. This change introduces a flag
	indicating that a monitor job is active, and a condition
	variable to synchronize access to this flag. This ensures that
	only a single thread can be making a state change or executing
	a monitor command at a time, while still allowing other API
	calls to be completed without blocking

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Release driver and domain lock when
	  running monitor commands. Re-add locking to disk passphrase
	  callback
	* src/qemu/THREADS.txt: Document threading rules

2009-11-10  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fully asynchronous monitor I/O processing
	Change the QEMU monitor file handle watch to poll for both
	read & write events, as well as EOF. All I/O to/from the
	QEMU monitor FD is now done in the event callback thread.

	When the QEMU driver needs to send a command, it puts the
	data to be sent into a qemuMonitorMessagePtr object instance,
	queues it for dispatch, and then goes to sleep on a condition
	variable. The event thread sends all the data, and then waits
	for the reply to arrive, putting the response / error data
	back into the qemuMonitorMessagePtr and notifying the condition
	variable.

	There is a temporary hack in the disk passphrase callback to
	avoid acquiring the domain lock.  This avoids a deadlock in
	the command processing, since the domain lock is still held
	when running monitor commands. The next commit will remove
	the locking when running commands & thus allow re-introduction
	of locking the disk passphrase callback

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Temporarily don't acquire lock in
	  disk passphrase callback. To be reverted in next commit
	* src/qemu/qemu_monitor.c, src/qemu/qemu_monitor.h: Remove

	Add reference counting on virDomainObjPtr objects
	Add reference counting on the virDomainObjPtr objects. With the
	forthcoming asynchronous QEMU monitor, it will be neccessary to
	release the lock on virDomainObjPtr while waiting for a monitor
	command response. It is neccessary to ensure one thread can't
	delete a virDomainObjPtr while another is waiting. By introducing
	reference counting threads can make sure objects they are using
	are not accidentally deleted while unlocked.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Add

	Make use of private data structure for monitor state
	Introduce a new qemuDomainObjPrivate object which is used to store
	the private QEMU specific data associated with each virDomainObjPtr
	instance. This contains a single member, an instance of the new
	qemuMonitorPtr object which encapsulates the QEMU monitor state.
	The internals of the latter are private to the qemu_monitor* files,
	not to be shown to qemu_driver.c

	* src/qemu/qemu_conf.h: Definition of qemuDomainObjPrivate.
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Register a functions for creating

	Allow character devices to have different target types
	A character device's target (it's interface in the guest) had only a
	single property: port. This patch is in preparation for adding targets
	which require other properties.
	Since this changes the conf type for character devices this affects
	a number of drivers:

	* src/conf/domain_conf.[ch] src/esx/esx_vmx.c src/qemu/qemu_conf.c
	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c src/uml/uml_conf.c src/uml/uml_driver.c
	  src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c src/xen/xend_internal.c src/xen/xm_internal.c:
	  target properties are moved into a union in virDomainChrDef, and a
	  targetType field is added to identify which union member should be
	  used. All current code which touches a virDomainChrDef is updated both
	  to use the new union field, and to populate targetType if necessary.

	LXC allow container to have ethN interfaces
	Current implementation of lxc driver creates vethN named
	interface(s) in the host and passes as it is to a container.
	The reason why it doesn't use ethN is due to the limitation
	that one namespace cannot have multiple iterfaces that have
	an identical name so that we give up creating ethN named
	interface in the host for the container.

	However, we should be able to allow the container to have
	ethN by changing the name after clone(CLONE_NEWNET).

	* src/lxc/lxc_container.c src/lxc/veth.c src/lxc/veth.h: do the clone
	  and then renames interfaces eth0 ... ethN to keep the interface names

2009-11-04  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Support reporting live interface IP/netmask
	This patch adds the flag VIR_INTERFACE_XML_INACTIVE to
	virInterfaceGetXMLDesc's flags. When it is*not* set (the default), the
	live interface info will be returned in the XML (in particular, the IP
	address(es) and netmask(s) will be retrieved by querying the interface
	directly, rather than  reporting what's in the config file). The
	backend of this is in netcf's ncf_if_xml_state() function.

	* configure.in libvirt.spec.in: requires netcf >= 0.1.3
	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: adds flag VIR_INTERFACE_XML_INACTIVE
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c src/interface/netcf_driver.c src/libvirt.c:

	through the parse/format step.

2009-11-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Move libvirtd event loop into background thread
	The virStateInitialize() call for starting up stateful drivers
	may require that the event loop is running already. This it is
	neccessary to start the event loop before this call. At the
	same time, network clients must not be processed until afte
	virStateInitialize has completed.

	The qemudListenUnix() and remoteListenTCP() methods must
	therefore not register file handle watches, merely open the
	network sockets & listen() on them. This means clients can
	connected and are queued, pending completion of initialization

	The qemudRunLoop() method is moved into a background thread
	that is started early to allow access to the event loop during
	driver initialization. The main process thread leader pretty
	much does nothing once the daemon is running, merely waits
	for the event loop thread to quit

	* daemon/libvirtd.c, daemon/libvirtd.h: Move event loop into
	  a background thread

	Allow NULL mac address in virGetInterface
	There are places where an interface will not have a mac address, and netcf

	Fix return value in virStateInitialize impl for LXC
	The LXC driver was mistakenly returning -1 for lxcStartup()
	in scenarios that are not an error. This caused the libvirtd

	but isn't.

	This patch disables automatical redirection following. The driver reports

	Don't let parent of daemon exit until basic initialization is done
	The daemonizing code lets the parent exit almost immediately. This
	means that it may think it has successfully started even when
	important failures occur like not being able to acquire the PID
	file. It also means network sockets are not yet open.

	To address this when daemonizing the parent passes an open pipe
	file descriptor to the child. The child does its basic initialization
	and then writes a status code to the pipe indicating either success,
	or failure. This ensures that when daemonizing, the parent does not
	exit until the pidfile is acquired & basic network sockets are open.

	Initialization of the libvirt drivers is still done asynchronously
	since this may take a very long time.

	Allow for a driver specific private data blob in virDomainObjPtr
	The virDomainObjPtr object stores state about a running domain.
	This object is shared across all drivers so it is not appropriate
	to include driver specific state here. This patch adds the ability
	to request a blob of private data per domain object instance. The
	driver must provide a allocator & deallocator for this purpose

	THis patch abuses the virCapabilitiesPtr structure for storing the
	allocator/deallocator callbacks, since it is already being abused
	for other internal things relating to parsing. This should be moved
	out into a separate object at some point.

	* src/conf/capabilities.h: Add privateDataAllocFunc and

	Convert virDomainObjListPtr to use a hash of domain objects
	The current virDomainObjListPtr object stores domain objects in
	an array. This means that to find a particular objects requires
	O(n) time, and more critically acquiring O(n) mutex locks.

	The new impl replaces the array with a virHashTable, keyed off
	UUID. Finding a object based on UUID is now O(1) time, and only
	requires a single mutex lock. Finding by name/id is unchanged
	in complexity.

	In changing this, all code which iterates over the array had
	to be updated to use a hash table iterator function callback.
	Several of the functions which were identically duplicating
	across all drivers were pulled into domain_conf.c

	* src/conf/domain_conf.h, src/conf/domain_conf.c: Change
	  virDomainObjListPtr to use virHashTable. Add a initializer
	  method virDomainObjListInit, and rename virDomainObjListFree
	  to virDomainObjListDeinit, since its not actually freeing
	  the container, only its contents. Also add some convenient
	  methods virDomainObjListGetInactiveNames,
	  virDomainObjListGetActiveIDs and virDomainObjListNumOfDomains
	  which can be used to implement the correspondingly named
	  public API entry points in drivers
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export new methods from domain_conf.h
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c, src/opennebula/one_driver.c,
	  src/openvz/openvz_conf.c, src/openvz/openvz_driver.c,
	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/test/test_driver.c,
	  src/uml/uml_driver.c, src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: Update all code
	  to deal with hash tables instead of arrays for domains

	libvirt-devel should only require libvirt-client
	There's a long known issue where if you install libvirt in a guest,
	the default virtual network will conflict with the default virtual
	network in the host.

	That's one of the reasons we have the libvirt-client RPM - it allows
	you to install the client library without having the host side
	installed.

	Rich Jones points out that if you install libvirt-devel in a guest,
	then you get libvirtd installed and the network conflict:

	  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/531200

	libvirt-devel should only require libvirt-client - e.g. nothing in
	the devel package pertains to anything in the libvirt RPM. The Fedora
	packaging guidelines say:

	  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging/Guidelines#Devel_Packages

	  Devel packages must require the base package using a fully versioned
	  dependency ...

	But for all intents and purposes, libvirt-client is our base RPM.

	* libvirt.spec.in: make libvirt-devel require libvirt-client

	virterror: Add a missing 'break' for VIR_ERR_INVALID_SECRET

	qemu: migrate: Don't require manual URI to specify a port
	The xen driver will generate a migration port if only a hostname is passed
	in the optional migrate URI, so let's do the same in qemu.

	Fix p2p migration without a passed uri.

	qemu: Fix an error message in GetVcpus

	test: Support virStorageFindPoolSources
	The results are hardcoded into the test driver, no option to read from a
	testfile is implemented at this time.

	storage: Add ParseSourceString function for use with FindPoolSources.
	This will simplify adding FindPoolSources support to more pool backends in
	the future (as well as the test driver).

	storage: Break out function to add pool source to a SourceList.
	Similar in theory to *AssignDef type functions, this duplicate functionality
	will be used by an future FindPoolSources implementations.

	storage: Break out pool source parsing to a separate function.
	We need to parse a source XML block for FindPoolSources, so this is a step
	in sharing the parsing. The new storage pool XML 2 XML tests cover this area
	pretty well to ensure we aren't causing regressions.

	Add support for an external TFTP boot server
	This patch adds an optional attribute to the <bootp> tag, that
	allows to specify a TFTP server address other than the address of
	the DHCP server itself.

	This can be used to forward the BOOTP settings of the host down to the
	guest.  This is something that configurations such as Xen's default
	network achieve naturally, but must be done manually for NAT.

	* docs/formatnetwork.html.in: Document new attribute.
	* docs/schemas/network.rng: Add it to schema.
	* src/conf/network_conf.h: Add it to struct.
	* src/conf/network_conf.c: Add it to parser and pretty printer.
	* src/network/bridge_driver.c: Put it in the dnsmasq command line.
	* tests/networkxml2xmlin/netboot-proxy-network.xml
	  tests/networkxml2xmlout/netboot-proxy-network.xml

2009-10-26  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Add a new syntax-check rule for gethostname.
	We should always be using virGetHostname in place of
	gethostname; thus add in a new syntax-check rule to make
	sure no new uses creep in.

	Various syntax-check fixes.
	Make a pass over the syntax-check files, tightening up regex's,
	un-ignoring certain files, and cleaning things up.

	Tighten up nonreentrant syntax-check.
	We can slightly tighten up the regex's used to detect the use of
	nonreentrant functions.  We can also check src/util/virterror.c
	by modifying a comment; I think it's worth it to get the additional
	coverage.

	Replace a gethostname by virGetHostname in libvirtd.c

	Replace two strcmp() by STREQ() in qemu_driver.c

	Replace gethostname by virGetHostname in xend_internal.c

	Remove a completely bogus reference increment in the Xen driver.
	xenUnifiedDomainEventRegister() calls out to
	virDomainEventCallbackListAdd(), which increments the reference
	count on the connection.  That is fine, but then
	xenUnifiedDomainEventRegister() increments the usage count again,
	leading to a usage count leak.  Remove the increment in the xen
	register, and the UnrefConnect in the xen unregister.

	Add a default log_level to qemudSetLogging to remove a build warning.
	(original patch from Charles Duffy)

	Better error message when libvirtd fails to start.

2009-10-22  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	Fix potential false-positive OOM error reporting.
	If no matching device was found (cap == NULL) then no strdup() call
	was made and *wwnn and *wwpn are untouched. Checking them for NULL
	in this situation may result in reporting an false-positive OOM error
	because *wwnn and *wwpn may be initialized to NULL by the caller.

	Only check *wwnn and *wwpn for NULL if a matching device was found
	(cap != NULL) and thus strdup() was called.

	* src/conf/node_device_conf.c: only report an OOM error if there
	  really is one

2009-10-22  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Consolidate virXPathNodeSet()
	virXPathNodeSet() could return -1 when doing an evaluation failure
	due to xmlXPathEval() from libxml2 behaviour.
	* src/util/xml.c: make sure we always return 0 unless the returned
	  XPath type is of the wrong type (meaning the query passed didn't
	  evaluate to a node set and code must be fixed)

	Don't copy old machines from a domain which has none
	If the the qemu and kvm binaries are the same, we don't include machine
	types in the kvm domain info.

	However, the code which refreshes the machine types info from the

	      <type arch='x86_64'>hvm</type>
	      ...
	    </os>
	  </domain>

	then the default machine type should be 'pc' and not 'pc-0.11'

	Issue was reported by Anton Protopopov.

	* src/capabilities.[ch]: pass the domain type to
	  virCapabilitiesDefaultGuestArch() and use it to look up the default
	  machine type from a specific guest domain if needed.

	* src/conf/domain_conf.c, src/xen/xm_internal.c: update

	Support a new peer-to-peer migration mode & public API
	Introduces several new public API options for migration

	 - VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER: With this flag the client only
	   invokes the virDomainMigratePerform method, expecting
	   the source host driver to do whatever is required to
	   complete the entire migration process.
	 - VIR_MIGRATE_TUNNELLED: With this flag the actual data
	   for migration will be tunnelled over the libvirtd RPC
	   channel. This requires that VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER is
	   also set.
	 - virDomainMigrateToURI: This is variant of the existing
	   virDomainMigrate method which does not require any
	   virConnectPtr for the destination host. Given suitable
	   driver support, this allows for all the same modes as
	   virDomainMigrate()

	The URI for VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER must be a valid libvirt
	URI. For non-p2p migration a hypervisor specific migration
	URI is used.

	virDomainMigrateToURI without a PEER2PEER flag is only
	support for Xen currently, and it involves XenD talking
	directly to XenD, no libvirtd involved at all.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h.in: Add VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER
	  flag for migration
	* src/libvirt_internal.h: Add feature flags for peer to
	  peer migration (VIR_FEATURE_MIGRATE_P2P) and direct
	  migration (VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER mode)
	* src/libvirt.c: Implement support for VIR_MIGRATE_PEER2PEER
	  and virDomainMigrateToURI APIs.
	* src/xen/xen_driver.c: Advertise support for DIRECT migration
	* src/xen/xend_internal.c: Add TODO item for p2p migration
	* src/libvirt_public.syms: Export virDomainMigrateToURI
	  method
	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Add support for PEER2PEER and
	  migration, and adapt TUNNELLED migration.
	* tools/virsh.c: Add --p2p and --direct args and use the

	  tunnelled migration

2009-10-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor native QEMU migration code
	The code for tunnelled migration was added in a dedicated method,
	but the native migration code is still inline in the top level
	qemudDomainMigratePerform() API. Move the native code out into
	a dedicated method too to make things more maintainable.

	* src/qemu/qemu_driver.c: Pull code for performing a native
	  QEMU migration out into separate method

2009-10-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't force dconn to be NULL in virDomainMigrate
	The code for tunnelled migration wierdly required the app to pass
	a  NULL 'dconn' parameter, only to have to use virConnectOpen
	itself shortly thereafter to get a 'dconn' object. Remove this
	bogus check & require the app to always pas 'dconn' as before

	* src/libvirt.c: Require 'dconn' for virDomainMigrate calls again
	  and remove call to virConnectOpen

2009-10-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Remove unneccessary uri_in parameter from virMigratePrepareTunnel
	Since virMigratePrepareTunnel() is used for migration over the
	native libvirt connection, there is never any need to pass the
	target URI to this method.

	* daemon/remote.c, src/driver.h, src/libvirt.c, src/libvirt_internal.h,
	  src/qemu/qemu_driver.c, src/remote/remote_driver.c,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.c, src/remote/remote_protocol.h,
	  src/remote/remote_protocol.x: Remove 'uri_in' parameter from
	  virMigratePrepareTunnel() method

2009-10-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Move the VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants
	Move the VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants into libvirt_internal.h
	since these flags are indicating whether  APIs in the
	libvirt_internal.h file are supported by a driver

	* src/driver.h: Remove VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants
	* src/libvirt_internal.h: Add VIR_DRV_FEATURE* constants, using
	  an enum instead of #define
	* src/internal.h: pull in libvirt_internal.h

	Fix configure.ac message vertical alignment
	* configure.in: Align messages in configuration summary

	LXC add augeas support for config file
	* src/lxc/libvirtd_lxc.aug src/lxc/test_libvirtd_lxc.aug: augeas schemas
	  for lxc.conf
	* src/Makefile.am libvirt.spec.in: glue the new augeas files in

2009-10-08  Amy Griffis  <amy.griffis@hp.com>

	LXC add driver config file lxc.conf
	* src/lxc/lxc.conf: new configuration file, there is currently one
	  tunable "log_with_libvirtd" that controls whether an lxc controller will
	  log only to the container log file, or whether it will honor libvirtd's
	  log output configuration. This provides a way to have libvirtd and its
	  children log to a single file.  The default is to log to the container
	  log file.
	* src/Makefile.am libvirt.spec.in: add the new file
	* src/lxc/lxc_conf.[ch] src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: read the new log value
	  from the configuration file and pass the log informations when
	  starting up a container.

	LXC do not truncate container log files on restart
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: use O_APPEND instead of O_TRUNC when opening
	  the log file on lxcVmStart()

	LXC initialize logging configuration
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c src/lxc/lxc_controller.c: before launching the
	  lxc controller, have the lxc driver query the log settings and setup
	  envp[]. This provides the advantage of honoring the actual log
	  configuration instead of only what had been set in the environment.
	  The lxc controller now simply has to call virLogSetFromEnv().

	Add debug for envp[] in virExecWithHook()
	* src/util/util.c: output some debug if caller of virExecWithHook have
	  set envp[]

2009-10-08  Amy Griffis  <amy.griffis@hp.com>

	Add accessors for logging filters and outputs
	When configuring logging settings, keep more information about the
	output destination. Add accessors to retrieve the filter and output
	settings in the original string form; this to be used to set up
	environment for a child process that also logs.

	* src/util/logging.[ch]: add virLogGetFilters and virLogGetOutputs
	  accessors and modify the internals (including virLogDefineOutput())
	  to save the data needed for the accessors

2009-10-08  Amy Griffis  <amy.griffis@hp.com>

	Add virFileAbsPath() utility
	* src/util/util.[ch]: Add virFileAbsPath() function to ensure an
	  absolute path for a potentially realtive path.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: add it in libvirt private symbols

2009-10-08  Jamie Strandboge  <jamie@canonical.com>

2009-10-07  Ryota Ozaki  <ozaki.ryota@gmail.com>

	LXC implement memory control APIs
	The patch implements the missing memory control APIs for lxc, i.e.,
	domainGetMaxMemory, domainSetMaxMemory, domainSetMemory, and improves
	domainGetInfo to return proper amount of used memory via cgroup.

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virCgroupGetMemoryUsage
	  and add missing virCgroupSetMemory
	* src/lxc/lxc_driver.c: Implement missing memory functions
	* src/util/cgroup.c, src/util/cgroup.h: Add the function
	  to get used memory

2009-10-07  Jamie Strandboge  <jamie@canonical.com>

	Add a domain argument to SVirt *RestoreImageLabel
	When James Morris originally submitted his sVirt patches (as seen in
	libvirt 0.6.1), he did not require on disk labelling for
	virSecurityDomainRestoreImageLabel. A later commit[2] changed this
	behavior to assume on disk labelling, which halts implementations for
	path-based MAC systems such as AppArmor and TOMOYO where
	vm->def->seclabel is required to obtain the label.

	* src/security/security_driver.h src/qemu/qemu_driver.c
	  src/security/security_selinux.c: adds the 'virDomainObjPtr vm'
	  argument back to *RestoreImageLabel

2009-10-07  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix up "make check"
	While running make check, I noticed that it was actually using
	the virsh binary from my system, in /usr/bin/virsh, and not the
	one that was just compiled.  This is actually caused by a bug
	in Makefile.am, where we didn't update the PATH to include tools.

	While here, I also updated all of the scripts to properly define
	the srcdir, abs_top_srcdir, and abs_top_builddir environment
	variables.  This is required if you want to be able to run the
	tests standalone (i.e. ./test instead of from make check).  I've
	tested this on both RHEL-5 and Fedora-10 machines, and make check
	works on both, as does running the individual tests by hand.

2009-10-06  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Create /var/log/libvirt/{lxc,uml} dirs
	Otherwise logrotate barfs:

	  error: error accessing /var/log/libvirt/uml: No such file or directory
	  error: libvirtd:1 glob failed for /var/log/libvirt/uml/*.log
	  error: found error in /var/log/libvirt/qemu/*.log /var/log/libvirt/uml/*.log /var/log/libvirt/lxc/*.log , skipping

	* qemud/Makefile.am: always create /var/log/libvirt/{lxc,uml} when
	  installing the logrotate conf; not ideal, but easier than making
	  the logrotate conf depend on which drivers are enabled

2009-10-06  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix rebuilding of devhelp files
	The devhelp/ directory files depend on libvirt-api.xml being
	uptodate, but automake always processes SUBDIRS before the
	current directory. So devhelp would be built and then the
	libvirt-api.xml re-build, invalidating the devhelp data again.

	To fix this all the rules for devhelp are moved directly
	into the docs/Makefile.am allowing make to see the global
	dependancy chain and thus build things in the correct order

	* docs/Makefile.am: Add rules for devhelp rebuild
	* docs/devhelp/Makefile.am: Remove devhelp rebuild
	* configure.in: Remove docs/devhelp/Makefile.am

2009-10-06  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

2009-10-06  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	test: Support loading node device info from file/XML
	Also add some XML examples.

	node conf: Make parsing routines consistent with other drivers
	Add virNodeDeviceParseFile, and make virNodeDeviceParseNode non-static. These

	python: Fix generated virInterface method names
	A mistake in the generator was causing virInterface methods to be generated
	with unpredicatable names ('ceUndefine', instead of just 'undefine'). This
	fixes the method names to match existing convention.

	Does anyone care if we are breaking API compat? My guess is that no one is
	using the python interface bindings yet.

2009-10-06  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	python: Use a pure python implementation of 'vir*GetConnect'
	The API docs explictly warn that we shouldn't use the C vir*GetConnect calls
	in bindings: doing so can close the internal connection pointer and cause
	things to get screwy. Implement these calls in python.

	python: Don't generate bindings for vir*Ref
	They are only for use in implementing the bindings, so shouldn't be
	exposed to regular API users.

	Fix memory leaks in libvirtd's message processing
	Commit 47cab734995fa9521b1df05d37e9978eedd8d3a2 changed the way how
	qemud_client_message objects were reused. Before this commit
	remoteDispatchClientRequest() reused the received message for normal responses
	and to report non-fatal errors. If a fatal error occurred qemudWorker() frees
	the message. After this commit non-fatal errors are reported by
	remoteSerializeReplyError() using a new qemud_client_message object and the
	original message leaks.

	To fix this leak the original message has to be freed if
	remoteSerializeReplyError() succeeds. If remoteSerializeReplyError()
	fails the original message is freed in qemudWorker().

	* daemon/dispatch.c: free qemud_client_message objects that will not be reused
	  and would leak otherwise, also free the allocated qemud_client_message object

	Allow control over QEMU audio backend
	When using VNC for graphics + keyboard + mouse, we shouldn't
	then use the host OS for audio. Audio should go back over
	VNC.

	When using SDL for graphics, we should use the host OS for
	audio since that's where the display is. We need to allow
	certain QEMU env variables to be passed through to guest
	too to allow choice of QEMU audio backend.

	* qemud/libvirtd.sysconf: Mention QEMU/SDL audio env vars
	* src/qemu_conf.c: Passthrough QEMU/SDL audio env for SDL display,
	  disable host audio for VNC display

	Maintain value of ctxt->node in virInterfaceDefParseDhcp
	* src/conf/interface_conf.c: This was causing subsequent calls to

	Fix API doc extractor to stop munging comment formatting
	The python method help docs are copied across from the C
	funtion comments, but in the process all line breaks and
	indentation was being lost. This made the resulting text
	and code examples completely unreadable. Both the API
	doc extractor and the python generator were destroying
	whitespace & this fixes them to preserve it exactly.

	* docs/apibuild.py: Preserve all whitespace when extracting
	  function comments. Print function comment inside a <![CDATA[
	  section to fully preserve all whitespace. Look for the
	  word 'returns' to describe return values, instead of 'return'
	  to avoid getting confused with code examples including the
	  C 'return' statement.
	* python/generator.py: Preserve all whitespace when printing
	  function help docs
	* src/libvirt.c: Change any return parameter indicated by
	  'return' to be 'returns', to avoid confusing the API extractor

	Fix up "make syntax-check" after the tree restructuring.

2009-09-23  Paolo Bonzini  <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	network: add 'bootp' and 'tftp' config
	Currently, libvirtd will start a dnsmasq process for the virtual
	network, but (aside from killing the dnsmasq process and replacing it),
	there's no way to define tftp boot options.

	This change introduces the appropriate tags to the dhcp configuration:

	 <network>
	   <name>default</name>
	   <bridge name="virbr%d" />
	   <forward/>
	   <ip address="192.168.122.1" netmask="255.255.255.0">
	     <tftp root="/var/lib/tftproot" />
	     <dhcp>
	       <range start="192.168.122.2" end="192.168.122.254" />
	       <bootp file="pxeboot.img"/>
	     </dhcp>
	   </ip>
	 </network>

	When the attributes are present, these are passed to the
	arguments to dnsmasq:

	 dnsmasq [...] --enable-tftp --tftp-root /srv/tftp --dhcp-boot pxeboot.img
	               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	                      from <tftp />                     from <bootp />

	At present, only local tftp servers are supported (ie, dnsmasq runs as
	the tftp server), but we could improve this in future by adding a
	server= attribute.

	Introduce virStrncpy.
	Add the virStrncpy function, which takes a dst string, source string,
	the number of bytes to copy and the number of bytes available in the
	dest string.  If the source string is too large to fit into the
	destination string, including the \0 byte, then no data is copied and
	the function returns NULL.  Otherwise, this function copies n bytes
	from source into dst, including the \0, and returns a pointer to the
	dst string.  This function is intended to replace all unsafe uses
	of strncpy in the code base, since strncpy does *not* guarantee that
	the buffer terminates with a \0.

	Fix handling of Xen(ner) detection
	Latest upstream QEMU can be built with Xen support, which introduces
	a -xen-domid argument. This was  mistakenly detected as -domid due
	to old Xenner support. Adapt to cope with both syntax. Also only
	set domid if the virt type is xen, or the guest type is xen

	* src/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu_conf.h: Detect new -xen-domid flag in

	Fix xen driver refcounting.
	The commit cb51aa48a777ddae6997faa9f28350cb62655ffd "Fix up connection
	reference counting." changed the driver closing and virConnectPtr
	unref-logic in virConnectClose().

	Before this commit virConnectClose() closed all drivers of the given
	virConnectPtr and virUnrefConnect()'ed it afterwards. After this
	commit the driver-closing is done in virUnrefConnect() if and only if
	the ref-count of the virConnectPtr dropped to zero.

	This change in execution order leads to a virConnectPtr leak, at least
	for connections to Xen.

	The relevant call sequences:

	virConnectOpen() -> xenUnifiedOpen() ...

	... xenInotifyOpen() -> virConnectRef(conn)

	... xenStoreOpen() -> xenStoreAddWatch() -> conn->refs++

	virConnectClose() -> xenUnifiedClose() ...

	... xenInotifyClose() -> virUnrefConnect(conn)

	... xenStoreClose() -> xenStoreRemoveWatch() -> virUnrefConnect(conn)

	Before the commit this additional virConnectRef/virUnrefConnect calls
	where no problem, because virConnectClose() closed the drivers
	explicitly and the additional refs added by the Xen subdrivers were
	removed properly. After the commit this additional refs result in a
	virConnectPtr leak (including a leak of the hypercall file handle;
	that's how I noticed this problem), because now the drivers are only
	close if and only if the ref-count drops to zero, but this cannot
	happen anymore, because the additional refs from the Xen subdrivers
	would only be removed if the drivers get closed, but that doesn't
	happen because the ref-count cannot drop to zero.

	The fix for this problem is simple: remove the
	virConnectRef/virUnrefConnect calls from the Xen subdrivers (see
	attached patch). Maybe someone could explain why the Xen Inotify and
	Xen Store driver do this extra ref-counting, but none of the other Xen
	subdrivers. It seems unnecessary to me and can be removed without
	problems.

	Add support for qcow encrypted volumes to qemu.
	Integrate with QEMU monitor to provide encryption passphrase when
	starting a guest using encrypted qcow volumes

	* src/qemu_driver.c (findDomainDiskEncryption,
	  findVolumeQcowPassphrase,
	  qemudMonitorSendVolumePassphrase, qemudMonitorSendCont): Send a volume
	  passphrase if qemu asks for it.

2009-09-11  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Provide missing passphrase when creating a volume.
	If the <encryption format='qcow'> element does not specify a secret
	during volume creation, generate a suitable secret and add it to the
	<encryption> tag.  The caller can view the updated <encryption> tag
	using virStorageVolGetXMLDesc().

	Similarly, when <encryption format='default'/> is specified while
	creating a qcow or qcow2-formatted volume, change the format to "qcow"
	and generate a secret as described above.

	* src/storage_encryption_conf.h (VIR_STORAGE_QCOW_PASSPHRASE_SIZE,
	  virStorageGenerateQcowPasphrase),
	  src/storage_encryption_conf.c (virStorageGenerateQcowPasphrase),

	* src/virsh.c: Add virsh commands.
	* docs/virsh.pod, virsh.1: Update documentation.

2009-09-11  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Local file implementation of secret driver API
	This implementation stores the secrets in an unencrypted text file,
	for simplicity in implementation and debugging.

	(Symmetric encryption, e.g. using gpgme, will not be difficult to add.
	Because the TLS private key used by libvirtd is stored unencrypted,
	encrypting the secrets file does not currently provide much additional
	security.)

	* include/libvirt/virterror.h, src/virterror.c (VIR_ERR_NO_SECRET): New
	  error number.
	* po/POTFILES.in, src/Makefile.am: Add secret_driver.

	avoid manually generating XML in other parts of libvirt.

	* src/secret_conf.c, src/secret_conf.h: New files.
	* po/POTFILES.in, src/Makefile.am: Add secret_conf.

2009-09-10  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Mask out flags used internally for virSecretGetValue
	Add a VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_INTERNAL_CALL flag value, replacing the
	originally separate libvirt_internal_call parameter.  The flag is used
	to differentiate external virSecretGetValue() calls from internal calls
	by libvirt drivers that need to use the secret even if it is private.

	* src/libvirt_internal.h Remove VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK
	* src/driver.h Add VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_FLAGS_MASK constant and
	  VIR_SECRET_GET_VALUE_INTERNAL_CALL. Re-add the
	  VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK constant
	* src/libvirt.c (virSecretGetValue): Don't allow the user to specify
	  internal flags.

	Consolidate "cont" into qemudMonitorSendCont()
	The interface allows qemudMonitorSendCont() to report errors that are
	not overridden by its callers.

	Also fix a potential infinite loop in qemuDomainCoreDump() if sending
	cont repeatedly fails.

	* src/qemu_driver.c (qemudMonitorSendCont): New function.
	  (qemudAutostartConfigs): Reset error before each call to
	  qemudStartVMDaemon().
	  (qemudInitCpus, qemudDomainResume, qemudDomainCoreDump,

	Fix misc thread locking bugs / bogus warnings
	Fix all thread locking bugs reported by object-locking test
	case.

	NB, some of the driver locking is getting too coarse. Driver
	mutexes really need to be turned into RW locks instead to
	significantly increase concurrency.

	* src/lxc_driver.c: Fix useof driver when unlocked in the methods
	  lxcDomainGetInfo, lxcSetSchedulerParameters, and
	  lxcGetSchedulerParameters

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Test that domain-specific qemu machine types are used correctly
	* tests/testutilsqemu.c: add a machine types list for /usr/bin/kvm
	  which doesn't have any aliases, while the guest has aliases

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-machine-aliases2.*,
	  tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: add a test using /usr/bin/kvm and make
	  sure that 'pc' machine type doesn't get canonicalized using the
	  aliases in the guest machine type list

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Simplify and fix qemudCanonicalizeMachine()
	The algorithm is quite simple:

	  If the emulator matches a guest's domain:
	    if domain has machine type info:
	      check the domain's machine type info
	    else
	      check the guest's default machine type info
	  else if the emulator matches the guest's default emulator:
	     check the guest's default machine type info

	The previous implementation was incorrectly falling back to the default
	machine type info if the domain's machine type info didn't have an
	alias.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: simplify and fix qemudCanonicalizeMachine()

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Probe machine types from kvm binary too
	Currently we only probe the main qemu binary for machine types, but we
	should also probe the kvm binary.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: probe kvm binary machines in qemudCapsInitGuest()

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Look up machine types from all domains in qemudGetOldMachines()
	Rather than just looking at the default domain info, look at all
	domains

	* src/qemu_conf.c: look at all domains in qemudGetOldMachines()

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Split up qemudGetOldMachines()
	We need to look at all the domain infos in guest capabilities, not
	just the defaults.

	In order to allow that, split out a qemudGetOldMachinesFromInfo()
	from qemudGetOldMachines(). We'll make more use of it in the next
	patch.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: split out qemudGetOldMachinesFromInfo() from

	Re-factor qemu test machine allocation code
	* test/testutilsqemu.c: split out code to testQemuAllocMachines()

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Canonicalize the qemu machine type in qemuxml2argvtest
	This doesn't have any affect on the current tests because we don't have
	any machine aliases in the current test data.

	* src/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu_driver.c: expose qemudCanonicalizeMachine()
	  for the tests

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: canonicalize the machine type

2009-09-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add esx and tcp migration uri transports to capabilities schema
	* docs/schemas/capabilities.rng: include esx and tcp uri_transport

2009-09-10  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix regression from "Avoid polling on FDs with no events"
	After the mentioned patch was applied, I noticed that
	shutting down a kvm guest from inside (i.e. poweroff) caused
	the guest to shutdown, but not removed from the list of
	active guests.  DanB pointed out that the problem is that
	the virEventAddHandle() call in the qemu driver was asking
	to watch for 0 events, not HANGUP | ERROR as it should.  Add
	these events so that shutdown works again.

2009-09-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

2009-09-09  Maximilian Wilhelm  <max@rfc2324.org>

	Check for libssh2 >= 1.0 for phy driver
	* configure.in: phyp driver uses libssh2_session_block_directions()

	VBox fix minor bugs in display and added OOM checks
	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: minor bug in selecting the graphics type. if the
	  graphics type was desktop it was assumed that display is set for it,

	lxc_container.c: avoid a leak on error paths
	* src/lxc_container.c (lxcContainerMountBasicFS): Don't leak upon failure.
	Add "cleanup:" label and change each post-allocation failure to
	use "goto cleanup" rather than returning immediately.

	qemu_conf.c: add a comment suggesting why we leave a dead-store
	* src/qemu_conf.c (qemuBuildHostNetStr): Do not remove the type_sep=','
	dead store, since not having it would be a problem if we ever add a

2009-09-04  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Avoid polling on FDs with no events enabled
	If a file descriptor with events=0 was added to the libvirtd
	event loop, it would still be added to the poll() fds' array.
	While it wouldn't see any POLLIN/OUT events, it'd still get
	triggered for HANGUP/ERROR events which was not in compliance
	with the libvirt events API contract.

	* qemud/event.c: Don't poll on FDs with events=0

2009-09-04  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	python: let libvirt_virConnectDomainEventCallback indicate success
	* python/libvir.c (libvirt_virConnectDomainEventCallback): Return 0
	when successful, rather than always returning -1.
	clang flagged this function for its dead-store of "ret=0".
	Once "ret" was set to 0, it was never used, and
	the function would always return -1.

	openvz_conf.c: don't use undefined local, "net"
	* src/openvz_conf.c (openvzReadNetworkConf): Initialize "net".
	Otherwise, upon openvzRead... failure, we would "goto error;"
	where an uninitialized "net" could be dereferenced.

	test.c: don't use undefined local, "def"
	* src/test.c (testOpenVolumesForPool): Upon early virAsprintf or
	virXPathNodeSet failure, "goto error" would take us to
	virStorageVolDefFree(def), but with "def" not defined.
	Initialize it to NULL.

	* src/storage_backend.c: Include "internal.h".
	(virStorageBackendCopyToFD): Mark inputvol parameter as "nonnull".
	Remove test for non-NULL inputvol.  Both callers ensure it's non-NULL.

	libvir.c: avoid NULL dereference in virStoragePoolSetAutostart
	* src/libvirt.c (virStoragePoolSetAutostart): Return -1 if the pool
	argument is invalid, rather than "goto error" where we could dereference
	that possibly-NULL "pool".
	(virConnectFindStoragePoolSources): Likewise.
	(virConnectNumOfDomains): Likewise.
	Daniel P. Berrange spotted that the two latter functions
	needed the same treatment.

	remote_internal.c: appease clang

	as non-NULL.  Remove now-unnecessary "conn == NULL" test.
	(remoteDevMonOpen): Likewise.

2009-09-02  Chris Lalancette  <clalance@redhat.com>

	Fix bugs in virDomainMigrate v2 code.
	Paolo Bonzini points out that in my refactoring of the code for
	virDomainMigrate(), I added a check for the return value from
	virDomainMigratePerform().  The problem is that we don't want to
	exit if we fail, we actually want to go on and do
	virDomainMigrateFinish2() with a non-0 return code to clean things
	up.  Remove the check.

	While reproducing this issue, I also noticed that we wouldn't
	always properly propagate an error message.  In particular, I
	found that if you blocked off the migration ports (with iptables)
	and then tried the migration, it would actually fail but we would
	get no failure output from Qemu.  Therefore, we would think we
	succeeded, and leave a huge mess behind us.  Execute the monitor
	command "info migrate", and look for a failure string in there
	as well.

2009-09-02  Matthias Bolte  <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

	VMware ESX: Don't warn on some query parameter
	* src/esx/esx_util.c: esxUtil_ParseQuery() warns if a known query

	  being NULL, instead of silently ignoring it. Fix the control flow.

	VMware ESX: Allow ethernet address type 'vpx'
	* src/esx/esx_vmx.c: add an extra type of addressType beside 'static'
	  and 'generated', 'vpx' indicates that the MAC address was generated
	  by a vCenter.

2009-09-02  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Don't blindly reorder disk drives
	Calling qsort() on the disks array causes disk to be
	unneccessarily re-ordered, potentially breaking the
	ability to boot if the boot disk gets moved later in
	the list. The new algorithm will insert a new disk as
	far to the end of the list as possible, while being
	ordered correctly wrt other disks on the same bus.

	* src/domain_conf.c, src/domain_conf.h: Remove disk sorting
	  routines. Add API to insert a disk into existing list at
	  the optimal position, without resorting disks
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virDomainDiskInsert
	* src/xend_internal.c, src/xm_internal.c: Remove calls to
	  qsort, use virDomainDiskInsert instead.
	* src/qemu_driver.c: Remove calls to qsort, use virDoaminDiskInsert
	  instead. Fix reordering bugs when hotunplugging disks and

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Don't assume buffered output echoes the command.
	The if ((nlptr...)) implicitly assumes commptr != NULL (and that "buf"

	* src/qemu_driver.c: Don't assume buffered monitor output echoes the
	  command.

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Attach encryption information to virDomainDiskDef.
	The XML allows <encryption format='unencrypted'/>, this implementation
	canonicalizes the internal representation so that "disk->encryption" is
	non-NULL iff encryption information is available.

	A domain with partial encryption information can be defined,
	completeness of the information is not verified.  The domain won't
	start until the remaining information is added, of course.

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Add support for encrypted (qcow) volume creation.
	Supports only virStorageVolCreateXML, not virStorageVolCreateXMLFrom.

	Curiously, qemu-img does not need the passphrase for anything to create
	an encrypted volume.  This implementation thus does not need to touch
	any secrets to work with cooperating clients.  More generic passphrase
	handling is added in the next patch.

	* src/storage_backend.c: Request encryption when creating qcow/qcow2
	  files
	* src/storage_backend_disk.c, src/storage_backend_fs.c,
	  src/storage_backend_logical.c: Refuse to create volumes with
	  encryption params set.

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Recognize encryption format of qcow volumes.
	(The implementation is not very generic, but that can be very
	easily rectified if/when new encryption formats appear.)

	* src/storage_backend_fs.c: Probe for qcow/qcow2 encryption
	  algorithm field

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Attach encryption information to virStorageVolDef.
	The XML allows <encryption format='unencrypted'/>, this implementation
	canonicalizes the internal representation so that "vol->encryption" is
	non-NULL iff the volume is encrypted.

	Note that partial encryption information (e.g. specifying an encryption
	format, but not the key/passphrase) is valid, libvirt will automatically
	choose value for the missing information during volume creation.  The
	user can read the volume XML, and use the unmodified <encryption> tag in
	future operations (without having to be able to understand) its contents.

	* docs/formatstorage.html, docs/formatstorage.html.in: Document
	  storage volume encryption options
	* src/storage_conf.c, src/storage_conf.h: Hook up storage
	  encryption XML handling
	* tests/storagevolschemadata/vol-qcow2.xml: Test case for encryption
	  schema changes

2009-09-02  Miloslav Trmač  <mitr@redhat.com>

	Add volume encryption information handling.
	Define an <encryption> tag specifying volume encryption format and
	format-depenedent parameters (e.g. passphrase, cipher name, key
	length, key).

	Currently the only defined parameter is a reference to a "secret"
	(passphrase/key) managed using the virSecret* API.

	Only the qcow/qcow2 encryption format, and a "default" format used to
	let libvirt choose the format during volume creation, is currently
	supported.

	This patch does not add any users; the <encryption> tag is added in
	the following patches to both volumes (to support encrypted volume
	creation) and domains.

	* docs/*.html: Re-generate
	* docs/formatstorageencryption.html.in, docs/sitemap.html.in:
	  Add page describing storage encryption data format
	* docs/schemas/Makefile.am, docs/schemas/storageencryption.rng:
	  Add RNG schema for storage encryption format
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add src/storage_encryption_conf.c
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: Export virStorageEncryption* functions
	* src/storage_encryption_conf.h, src/storage_encryption_conf.c: Internal
	  helper APIs for dealing with storage encryption format
	* libvirt.spec.in, mingw32-libvirt.spec.in: Add storageencryption.rng
	  RNG schema

	support lzop save compression for qemu
	Per prior discussion -- this was, indeed, trivial.

	I'm a little disappointed to be breaking the ordering characteristics of
	the enum (as it had been ordered by increasing time requirements and
	decreasing output size), but breaking any save files with the old
	constants in the headers would of course be worse.

	Subject: [PATCH] support lzop save compression for qemu

	One of the larger disincentives towards use of compression for migrated-out save
	files is performance impact. This patch adds support for lzop; CPU time for
	compression is about 5x faster than gzip (the next most performant algorithm)
	and decompression is about 3x faster.

	OpenVZ: accept NULL as type for GetMaxVCPUs.
	All of the other drivers that support the getMaxVcpus callback
	also accept a NULL value for type.  Make openvz also accept a
	NULL value.

	Remove use of strncpy in qemudExtractMonitorPath.
	qemudExtractMonitorPath() was doing a VIR_ALLOC_N followed by a
	strncpy.  However, this isn't necessary; we can do the same thing
	using strndup, which is much safer.

	Fix up virNodeGetCellsFreeMemory
	The documentation for virNodeGetCellsFreeMemory claims the values
	returned are in kilobytes, but that's actually wrong; the value
	returned is actually in bytes.  Fix up the documentation to be
	correct.

	Fix phypOpen() escape_specialcharacters
	Matthias correctly points out that escape_specialcharaters() takes a
	length, and since we are now malloc()'ing string in phypOpen instead of
	making it a static array, we can't use sizeof(string) anymore.  Calculate
	the proper strlen and then use that both to allocate the string and also
	pass it to escape_specialcharacters().

	Power Hypervisor: fix potential segfault
	I came across this line in the phypOpen function:

	char string[strlen(conn->uri->path)];

	Here the path part of the given URI is used without checking it for
	NULL, this can cause a segfault as strlen expects a string != NULL.
	Beside that uuid_db and connection_data leak in case of an error.

	In this line

	conn->uri->path = string;

	the original path of the URI leaks. The patch adds a VIR_FREE call
	before setting the new path.

	The attached patch is compile-tested but I don't have a Power
	Hypervisor installation at hand to test it for real.

	Maintain a list of active PCI hostdevs and use it in pciResetDevice()
	As we start/shutdown guests, or hotplug/hot-unplug devices, we can add
	or delete devices as appropriate from a list of active devices.

	Then, in pciReset(), we can use this to determine whether its safe to
	reset a device as a side effect of resetting another device.

	* src/qemu_conf.h: add activePciHostdevs to qemud_driver

	* src/qemu_driver.c: maintain the activePciHostdevs list, and pass it
	  to pciResetDevice()

	Simplify PCI hostdev prepare/re-attach using a pciDeviceList type
	The qemuPrepareHostDevices() and qemuDomainReAttachHostDevices()
	functions are clutter with a bunch of calls to pciGetDevice() and
	pciFreeDevice() obscuring the basic logic.

	Add a pciDeviceList type and add a qemuGetPciHostDeviceList() function
	to build a list from a domain definition. Use this in prepare/re-attach
	fto simplify things and eliminate the multiple pciGetDevice calls.

	This is especially useful because in the next patch we need to iterate
	the hostdevs list a third time and we also need a list type for keeping
	track of active devices.

	* src/pci.[ch]: add pciDeviceList type and also a per-device 'managed'
	  property

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export the new functions

	Revert changes to allow pciResetDevice() reset multiple devices
	It turns out that the previous attempt at this doesn't work well

	disallow the reset affecting devices already attach to the guest,
	but we still need to avoid double locking the virDomainObjPtr.

	This is all getting messy, I've a better idea.

	This reverts commit 6318808270dd7679cd5dc082dcf2c7d85a432bd6 and
	c106c8a18c63d9e4f2547724a4a563706f8f6778.

	Fix up connection reference counting.
	Currently the reference counting for connections is busted.  I
	first noticed it while trying to use virConnectRef; it would
	eventually cause a crash in the remote_internal driver, although
	that was really just a victim.  Really, we should only call the
	close callbacks on the methods when the references drop to 0.  To
	accomplish this, move all of the close callbacks into
	virUnrefConnect (since there are lots of internal users of that
	function), and arrange for virConnectClose to call that.

	V2: Make sure to drop the connection lock before we call the close
	    callbacks, otherwise we could deadlock the daemon
	V3: Fix up a crash when we got an error from one of the drivers

	Compressed save image format for Qemu.
	Implement a compressed save image format for qemu.  While ideally
	we would have the choice between compressed/non-compressed
	available to the libvirt API, unfortunately there is no "flags"
	parameter to the virDomainSave() API.  Therefore, implement this
	as a qemu.conf option.  gzip, bzip2, and lzma are implemented, and
	it should be very easy to implement additional compression
	methods.

	One open question is if/how we should detect the compression
	binaries.  One way to do it is to do compile-time setting of the
	paths (via configure.in), but that doesn't seem like a great thing
	to do.  My preferred solution is not to detect at all;
	when we go to run the commands that need them, if they
	aren't available, or aren't available in one of the standard paths,
	then we'll fail.  That's also the solution implemented in this patch.

	In the future, we'll have a more robust (managed) save/restore API,
	at which time we can expose this functionality properly in the API.

	V2: get rid of redundant dd command and just use >> to append data.
	V3: Add back the missing pieces for the enum and bumping the save version.
	V4: Make the compressed field in the save_header an int.
	    Implement LZMA compression.

	Check active domain hostdevs before allowing PCI reset
	If a PCI device reset causes other devices to be reset, allow it so long
	as those other devices are note assigned to another active domain.

	Note, we need to take the driver lock qemudNodeDeviceReset() because the
	check function will iterate over the domain list.

	Allow pciResetDevice() to reset multiple devices
	When using a Secondary Bus Reset, all devices on the bus are reset.

	Extend the pciResetDevice() API so that a 'check' callback can be
	supplied which will verify that it is safe to reset the other devices
	on the bus.

	The virDomainObjPtr parameter is needed so that when the check function
	iterates over the domain list, it can avoid double locking.

	* src/pci.[ch]: add a 'check' callback to pciResetDevice(), re-work
	  pciIterDevices() to pass the check function to the iter functions,
	  use the check function in the bus iterator, return the first unsafe
	  device from pciBusCheckOtherDevices() and include its details in
	  the bus reset error message.

	* src/qemu_driver.c, src/xen_uninified.c: just pass NULL as the
	  check function for now

2009-08-14  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Improve PCI host device reset error message
	Currently, if we are unable to reset a PCI device we return a fairly
	generic 'No PCI reset capability available' error message.

	Fix that by returning an error from the individual reset messages and
	using that error to construct the higher level error mesage.

	* src/pci.c: set errors in pciTryPowerManagementReset() and
	  pciTrySecondaryBusReset() on failure; use those error messages
	  in pciResetDevice(), or explain that no reset support is available

2009-08-14  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Reset and re-attach PCI host devices on guest shutdown
	When the guest shuts down, we should attempt to restore all PCI host
	devices to a sane state.

	In the case of managed hostdevs, we should reset and re-attach the
	devices. In the case of unmanaged hostdevs, we should just reset them.

	Note, KVM will already reset assigned devices when the guest shuts
	down using whatever means it can, so we are only doing it to cover the
	cases the kernel can't handle.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemuDomainReAttachHostDevices() and call
	  it from qemudShutdownVMDaemon()

2009-08-14  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Allow PM reset on multi-function PCI devices
	It turns out that a PCI Power Management reset only affects individual
	functions, and not the whole device.

	The PCI Power Management spec talks about resetting the 'device' rather
	than the 'function', but Intel's Dexuan Cui informs me that it is
	actually a per-function reset.

	Also, Yu Zhao has added pci_pm_reset() to the kernel, and it doesn't
	reject multi-function devices, so it must be true! :-)

	(A side issue is that we could defer the PM reset to the kernel if we
	could detect that the kernel has PM reset support, but barring version
	number checks we don't have a way to detect that support)

	* src/pci.c: remove the pciDeviceContainsOtherFunctions() check from
	  pciTryPowerManagementReset() and prefer PM reset over bus reset
	  where both are available

	Add host PCI device hotplug support
	Attaching a host PCI device to a qemu guest is done with a
	straightforward 'pci_add auto host host=XX:XX.X' command.

	Like with NIC and disk hotplug, we need to retain the guest PCI address
	assigned by qemu so that we can use it for hot-unplug.

	Identifying a device for detach is done using the host PCI address.

	Managed mode is handled by detaching/resetting the device before
	attaching it to the guest and re-attaching it after detaching it from
	the guest.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudDomainAttachHostPciDevice() and

	A couple of minor fixes to phyp escape_specialcharacters.  Make it

	Run 'cont' on successful migration finish.
	As of qemu 0.10.6, qemu now honors the -S flag on incoming migration.
	That means that when the migration completes, we have to issue a

	since it won't hurt on older qemu.

	Split virDomainMigrate into functions.
	Re-factor virDomainMigrate to split out the version 1 and version 2
	protocols into their own functions.  In reality, the two versions share
	very little in common, so forcing them together in the same function was
	just confusing.  This will also make adding tunnelled migration easier.

	Fix QEMU domain status after restore.
	When doing a restore, we were forgetting to update the state file
	for the VM.  That means that if you do a save/restore, then shut
	down libvirtd, then start it back up, you'll see the state of the
	guest as "paused", even though it is really running.  We were

	Set perms on /var/lib/libvirt/boot to 0711
	Allow qemu user to open kernel/initrds in this dir, but still prevent

	chown kernel/initrd before spawning qemu
	If we're running qemu unprivileged, we need to chown any supplied kernel

	* src/qemu_driver.c: rename qemuDomainSetDiskOwnership() to
	  qemuDomainSetFileOwnership(), pass it a path string instead of a disk

	Remove unsafe strncpy from esx_vmx.c
	While trying to remove uses of unsafe strncpy in the tree, I came
	across a couple of usages in the ESX driver.  To my eyes, the snprintf
	replacements do the same thing in less code, and are also safer.

	Tested-by: Mattias Bolte <matthias.bolte@googlemail.com>

2009-08-06  Amy Griffis  <amy.griffis@hp.com>

	Update logging documentation
	* docs/logging.html[.in] try to include a little more description about
	  the corner cases, things someone might get hung up on on.

	Consolidate code for parsing the logging env
	* src/logging.c src/logging.h src/libvirt_private.syms:
	  define new functions virLogSetFromEnv and virLogParseDefaultPriority
	* qemud/qemud.c src/libvirt.c tests/eventtest.c: cleanup to use the
	  unified functions

	Cleanup VIR_LOG_DEBUG parsing in eventtest
	* tests/eventtest.c: don't covert high priority levels to debug level.
	  Consider an invalid priority level setting a setup failure.

	Several fixes to libvirtd's log setup
	* qemud/qemud.c src/logging.[ch]: Similar as for general libvirt, don't
	  convert high priority levels to debug level. Ignore LIBVIRT_LOG_FILTERS
	  and LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS when they're set to the empty string, otherwise
	  they can override a valid setting from the config file. Send all
	  settings through the parser functions for validation, so that the
	  existence of a bad setting doesn't nullify a good setting that should
	  have applied -- particularly the default output. Keep the order of
	  precedence consistent for all variables between the environment and
	  the config file.  Warn when an invalid log level, filter, or output
	  is ignored.
	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export internally a few convenience functions

	Tighten libvirt's parsing of logging env
	* src/libvirt.c src/logging.c: Don't convert high priority levels to the
	  debug level. Don't parse LIBVIRT_LOG_FILTERS and LIBVIRT_LOG_OUTPUTS
	  when they're set to the empty string. Warn when the user specifies an
	  invalid value (empty string remains a noop).
	* po/POTFILES.in: src/logging.c now include translatable strings

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add support for attaching network/bridge NICs in QEMU driver
	In order to hotplug a network/bridge backed NIC, we need to first create
	the tap file descriptor, add the tap interface to the bridge and then
	pass the file descriptor to the qemu process using the 'getfd' monitor
	command.

	Once the tapfd has been accepted, we create the network backend using
	host_net_add, supplying the name assigned to the tapfd. If this fails,
	we need to close the tapfd in qemu using the 'closefd' monitor command.

	If the version of qemu does not support the getfd/closefd monitor
	commands we detect "unknown command" in the getfd reply and fail the
	attach operation.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add support for tapfd based hotplug in
	  qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add SCM_RIGHTS support to QEMU monitor code
	Add qemudMonitorCommandWithFd() which allows a file descriptor to be
	sent to qemu over a unix monitor socket using SCM_RIGHTS. See the
	unix(7) and cmsg(3) man pages.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add a scm_fd param to qemudMonitorCommandExtra(),
	  add qemudMonitorCommandWithFd(), implement SCM_RIGHTS support in
	  qemudMonitorSendUnix()

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Use sendmsg() on QEMU monitor socket
	Switch from using write() to using sendmsg() on QEMU's monitor socket
	so that we can add support for SCM_RIGHTS.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add sendmsg() based qemudMonitorSendUnix() and use
	  it when the monitor fd is a unix socket

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Factor qemudMonitorSend() out of qemudMonitorCommandExtra()
	Add a little helper function to write the monitor command followed by
	carriage return in a single write.

	This doesn't make any real difference, but allows us to more easily
	switch to using sendmsg() when using the monitor over a unix socket.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: split qemudMonitorSend() out

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Clean up error handling in qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()
	In subsequent patches we're going to have a file descriptor to close

	* src/qemu_conf.c: in qemudDomainAttachNetDevice() consolidate the
	  error handling cleanups together

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Make qemuBuildHostNetStr() take tapfd as a string
	With hotplug, we're going to want to pass a tapfd name rather than an

	* src/qemu_conf.h: qemuBuildHostNetStr() takes a string tapfd now

	* src/qemu_conf.c: pass qemuBuildHostNetStr() a string rather than an
	  actual file descriptor

	* src/qemu_driver.c: update qemudDomainAttachNetDevice() for change

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Only probe qemu for machine types when binary changes
	By probing for qemu machine types, we increased the time of a
	GetCapabilities call from 100us to a whopping 60ms.

	This patch takes the approach of only probing for machine types
	when the mtime of the emulator binary changed since the last time
	the capabilities were generated.

	* src/capabilities.h: cache the emulator binary mtime

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemudGetOldMachines() to copy the machine
	  types from the old caps struct if the mtime for the binary hasn't
	  changed

	* src/qemu_conf.h, src/qemu_driver.c: pass the old caps pointer to
	  qemudCapsInit()

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Probe QEMU directly for machine aliases if not found in capabilties
	Not all possible emulators are actually in the capabilities, so if we
	don't find the supplied emulator we should probe it directly for machine
	types.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudCanonicalizeMachineDirect() to directly
	  probe an emulator for the canonical machine type

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Canonicalize qemu machine types
	In qemu-0.11 there is a 'pc-0.10' machine type which allows you to run
	guests with a machine which is compatible with the pc machine in
	qemu-0.10 - e.g. using the original PCI class for virtio-blk and
	virtio-console and disabling MSI support in virtio-net. The idea here
	is that we don't want to suprise guests by changing the hardware when
	qemu is updated.

	I've just posted some patches for qemu-0.11 which allows libvirt to
	canonicalize the 'pc' machine alias to the latest machine version.

	This patches makes us use that so that when a guest is configured to
	use the 'pc' machine type, we resolve that to 'pc-0.11' machine and
	save that in the guest XML.

	See also:

	  https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/KVM_Stable_Guest_ABI

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemudCanonicalizeMachine() to canonicalize
	  the machine type according to the machine aliases in capabilities

	* src/qemu_driver.c: parse aliases in qemudParseMachineTypesStr()

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add virCapsGuestMachine structure
	A subsequent commit will add a "canonical" field to this structure,
	this patch basically just prepares the way for that.

	The new type is added, along with virCapabilitiesAlloc/FreeMachines()
	helpers and a whole bunch of code to make the transition.

	One quirk is that virCapabilitiesAddGuestDomain() and
	virCapabilitiesAddGuest() take ownership of the machine list rather
	than duping it. This makes sense to avoid needless copying.

	* src/capabilities.h: add the virCapsGuestMachine struct and use it
	  in virCapsGuestDomainInfo, add prototypes for new functions and
	  update the AddGuest() prototypes

	* src/capabilities.c: add code for allocating and freeing the new

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Probe for QEMU machine types
	Currently we hardcode the QEMU machine types. We should really just
	parse the output of 'qemu -M ?' so the lists don't get out of sync.

	xenner doesn't support '-M ?', so we still need to hardcode that.

	The horrible (const char *const *) is removed in a subsequent patch.

	* src/qemu_conf.c: kill the arch_info*machines tables, retain the
	  hardcoded xenner machine type, add qemudProbeMachineTypes() to
	  run and parse 'qemu -M ?' and use it in qemudCapsInitGuest()

2009-07-27  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Cleanup qemu binary detection logic in qemudCapsInitGuest()
	There's no need for the hasbase/hasaltbase confusion, just store the

	Commit newly generated docs, after changes from commit 2348cf.

	Add phyp files to POTFILES, to make syntax-check happy.

	test: Implement BlockStats and InterfaceStats
	We fake stats values based on the current time, similar to how it's done
	for cpu time.

	test: Generate net interface names when assigning XML.
	We need interface names to implement InterfaceStats.

	Don't allow NULL paths for BlockStats and InterfaceStats
	Do the check in libvirt.c, to save drivers from the burden. This changes
	behavior slightly in the qemu driver: we no longer explictly error if
	passed an empty string. An error will still be thrown when the device
	lookup fails.

	python: Raise exceptions if virDomain*Stats fail.
	The generator couldn't tell that the stats return values were pointers.
	Stick a white list in the function which tries to make this distinction.

2009-07-24  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor cgroups to allow a group per driver to be managed directly
	Allow the driver level cgroup to be managed explicitly by the
	hypervisor drivers, in order to detect whether to enable or

	Fix misc Win32 compile warnings
	GCC >= 4.4 assumes the 'printf' attribute refers to the native
	runtime libraries format specifiers. Thanks to gnulib, libvirt
	has GNU format specifiers everywhere.  This means we need to
	use 'gnu_printf' with GCC >= 4.4 to get correct compiler
	checking of printf format specifiers.

	* HACKING: Document new rules for ATTRIBUTE_FMT_PRINTF

	Always add -no-kvm and -no-kqemu, for qemu domains
	If the qemu binary supports "-no-kvm" and/or "-no-kqemu", they should
	always be added for plain "qemu" domains.  Previously, we omitted them
	whenever the host and guest architectures implied that they would be
	disabled automatically, but that logic was flawed in some cases
	(such as i686 and x86_64).
	* src/qemu_conf.c: fix the conditions for adding "-no-kvm" and/or "-no-kqemu"

	Fix typo in storage cloning

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add support for network device detach
	qemu network devices are hot-unplugged in two stages - first the PCI NIC
	is removed using 'pci_del <pci_addr>' and then the backend is removed
	using 'host_net_remove <vlan> <name>'.

	In order to perform these operations we need to have retained the
	PCI address, backend name and vlan number.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudDomainDetachNetDevice()

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Retain PCI address from NIC attach
	When we pci_add a NIC, we need to retain the PCI address assigned by
	qemu for using during detach.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: use qemudParsePciAddReply() to pull the PCI
	  address from the pci_add reply

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle storing and parsing the PCI address in the
	  domain state XML file

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Re-factor pci_add reply parsing and parse domain/bus numbers
	The current code for parsing pci_add replies ignores the the domain and
	bus numbers. Re-write the code to rectify that.

	Also, since pci_add is used for NIC hotplug as well ask disk hotplug,
	re-factor the code into a separate function.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudParsePciAddReply() function which can
	  handle parsing domain and bus numbers

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Remove the network backend if NIC hotplug fails
	If we fail to pci_add a NIC, we should remove the network backend and
	leave things the way we found them. To do that, we pre-allocate a
	host_net_remove monitor command and issue that if the pci_add fails.
	If the remove fails, we just log a warning.

	We can only do this if we have a name for the network backend and
	we know the vlan number its associated with.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: host_net_remove the network backend if the
	  pci_add fails

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Basic qemu NIC hotplug support
	Implement basic NIC hotplug support using the 'host_net_add' and
	'pci_add' qemu monitor commands.

	For now, we don't support 'bridge' or 'network' types.

	Also, if pci_add fails, we currently fail to remove the backend
	which we added.

	Finally, NIC hot-unplug support is missing.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudDomainAttachNetDevice()

	* src/qemu_conf.[ch]: export qemuBuildNicStr(), qemuBuildHostNetStr()
	  and qemuAssignNames()

	* src/libvirt_private.syms: export virDomainNetTypeToString()

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Make qemuCmdFlags available in qemudDomainAttachDevice()
	qemudDomainChangeEjectableMedia() currently extracts the qemu command
	line flags, but other device attaching code might need it, so move
	the qemudExtractVersionInfo() call up a frame.

	* src/qemu_driver.c: move the qemudExtractVersionInfo() call from
	  qemudDomainChangeEjectableMedia() to qemudDomainAttachDevice()

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Store the interface vlan number in the domain state
	Currently, an interface's vlan number corresponds to its index in
	the table of network interfaces. That is no longer true when we
	allow devices to be removed.

	To fix this, we store the vlan number in the domain's state XML
	so that it survives libvirtd restarts.

	* src/domain_conf.h: add vlan number to virDomainNetDef

	* src/domain_conf.c: store it in XML as <state vlan='N'/>, defaulting
	  to -1 if this is state saved by a previous version of libvirt

	* src/qemu_conf.c: assign vlan numbers before starting qemu

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add NIC and hostnet names to domain state XML
	The qemu driver needs to assign and keep track of identifiers for
	network devices so that it can remove them. We need to keep this state
	across libvirtd restarts, but it's not configuration that needs to
	be kept across guest restarts.

	* src/domain_conf.c: parse and format <state nic="foo" hostnet="bar"/>

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Assign names to qemu NICs and network backends
	We need these so that we can remove the devices via the monitor.

	* src/domain_conf.h: add nic_name and hostnet_name to virDomainNetDef

	* src/domain_conf.c: free nic_name and hostnet_name

	* src/qemu_conf.c: add qemuAssignNetNames(), use it if qemu has
	  support for the param and pass the names on the command line

	* tests/qemuxml2argv*: add a test for this

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add checks for some NIC hotplug related features added in qemu-0.10.0
	Add QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_NET_NAME to indicate that '-net ...,name=foo' is
	supported and QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_HOST_NET_ADD to indicate that the
	'host_net_add' monitor command is available.

	Set both these flags if the qemu version is greater than 0.10.0.
	Checking via the '-help' output would not work for the monitor command
	and even for the command line arg, it would be quite fragile.

	* src/qemu_conf.h: add new flags as aliases of QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10

	* src/qemu_conf.c: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10 for versions >= 0.10.0

	* tests/qemuhelptest.c: set QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_0_10 for the appropriate
	  qemu versions

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Factor qemuBuildHostNetStr() out from qemuBuildCommandLine()
	Re-factor this code so that it can be used for NIC hotplug
	too. The awkward prefix and type_sep arguments are needed to
	allow us to do "host_net_add tap vlan=..."

	* src/qemu_conf.c: factor the net backend string formatting
	  code into its own function

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Factor qemuBuildNicStr() out from qemuBuildCommandLine()
	Re-factor this code so that it can be used for NIC hotplug
	too. The awkward arguments are needed to allow use to do
	"pci_add auto nic macaddr=..."

	* src/qemu_conf.c: factor the nic string formatting code into
	  its own function

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Retain disk PCI address across libvirtd restarts
	When we hot-plug a disk device into a qemu guest, we need to retain its
	PCI address so that it can be removed again later. Currently, we do
	retain the slot number, but not across libvirtd restarts.

	Add <state devaddr="xxxx:xx:xx"/> to the disk device XML config when the
	VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS flag is used. We still don't parse the
	domain and bus number, but the format allows us to do that in future.

	* src/domain_conf.h: replace slotnum with pci_addr struct, add helper
	  for testing whether the address is valid

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle formatting and parsing the address

	* src/qemu_driver.c: store the parsed slot number as a full PCI address,
	  and use this address with the pci_del monitor command

	* src/vbox/vbox_tmpl.c: we're debug printing slotnum here even though
	  it can never be set, just delete it

2009-07-22  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add internal XML parsing/formatting flag
	We need to store things like device names and PCI slot numbers in the
	qemu domain state file so that we don't lose that information on
	libvirtd restart. Add a flag to indicate that this information should
	be parsed or formatted.

	Make bit 16 and above of the flags bitmask for internal use only and
	consume the first bit for this new status flag.

	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h: add VIR_DOMAIN_XML_FLAGS_MASK

	* src/libvirt.c: reject private flags in virDomainGetXMLDesc()

	* src/domain_conf.h: add VIR_DOMAIN_XML_INTERNAL_STATUS

	* src/domain_conf.c: pass the flag from virDomainObjParseXML() and
	  virDomainSaveStatus

2009-07-21  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Add interface object list manipulation functions
	* interface_conf.c interface_conf.h: utilities function usful for

	virGetinterface matching of MAC and interface name
	MAC address of a particular interface may change over time, and the
	reduced virInterface object (which contains just name and mac) needs
	to reflect these changes. Since we can't modify the mac address of an
	existing virInterface (some other thread may currently be using it) we
	just create a new virInterface, and let the old one die a dignified
	death when its refct goes to 0.
	* src/datatypes.c: fix the matching and lifetime of virInterface object
	  accordingly

	Add an error code for conflicting mac addresses
	* include/libvirt/virterror.h src/virterror.c: if a driver's

	qemu: Try multiple times to open unix monitor socket
	Unlike the pty monitor (which we know exists since we scrape its path from
	stdout), we have no way of knowing that the unix monitor socket should exist/
	be initialized. As a result, some of my KVM guests randomly fail to start on
	F10 host.

	Try to open the unix socket in a 3 second timeout loop. Ignore EACCES (path
	does not exist if a first time run) and ECONNREFUSED (leftover socket from
	a previous run hasn't been removed yet). Fixes things for me.

	storage: Implement CreateVolFrom for logical and disk backend.
	With the previous refactoring, this is a simple process, since the global
	'CreateBlockFrom' in storage_backend does all the work.

	storage: Don't try sparse detection if writing to block device.
	We don't gain any space savings, so skip the detection to speed up
	the cloning operation.

	storage: Implement 'CreateBlockFrom' helper.
	Add a 'CreateBlockFrom' in the global storage_backend, which sets up the
	destination block device: CopyFromFD does the rest of the cloning.

	storage: Break out actual raw cloning to separate function.
	The CreateRaw function has some 'file' only assumptions, so break the agnostic
	cloning bits to a separate function.

	storage: cleanup: do away with 'createFile'
	Have storage building functions be definitions of
	virStorageBackendBuildVolFrom: we will need to do this in the future anyways
	if we ever support the flags attribute.

	storage: Move most of the FS creation functions to common backend.
	These will be used by other pool cloning implementations.

2009-07-17  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	storage: Refactor FS backend 'create' function choosing.
	Break out separate functions for

	- Determining the supported '*-img' tool,
	- The tool's associated create function,
	- Desired function for cloning (CreateXMLFrom).

	This will be eventually used to unify cloning across all backends.

2009-07-17  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	storage: Fix deadlock when cloning across pools.
	We need to unlock the first pool before looking up the second, since the
	search locks every pool it checks.

	storage: disk: Use capacity, not allocation, when creating volume.
	There isn't any way to dictate allocation when creating disk volumes, so
	capacity is the only relevant value.

2009-07-17  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	storage: disk: Default to 'ext2' for new volumes.
	Currently, if no format is specified for a new disk volume, we pass the
	invalid value "none" as the FS type to 'parted mkpart'.

	There doesn't seem to be a way to have parted not format the drive, so
	just default to using 'ext2' in this case: this shouldn't cause any harm,
	since we are creating a new partition in the first place.

2009-07-17  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	storage: disk: Fix segfault creating volume without target path
	Remove unneeded target path duplication, which could carelessly dereference
	NULL. Make it clear where 'key' is actually filled in.

	storage: disk: Fix parthelper '-g' option handling.
	Typo was breaking 'parthelper -g', preventing disk pool definition.

	build: submodule machinery now works also when no tag is reachable
	The code in cfg.mk to detect when the git submodule was out of date
	worked most of the time, but not when checked out in a certain way.
	* cfg.mk: Extract submodule hash from command output and file,
	and compare only that, since the format of the full line may vary.
	Reported by Mike Burns, with some diagnosis by Daniel P Berrange.

2009-07-17  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Run QEMU guests as an unprivileged user
	* configure.in: Add --with-qemu-user and --with-qemu-group args
	* libvirt.spec.in: use 'qemu' for user/group for Fedora >= 12
	* qemud/libvirtd_qemu.arg, qemud/test_libvirtd_qemu.aug,
	  src/qemu.conf: Add 'user' and 'group' args for configuration
	* src/Makefile.am: Create %localstatedir/cache/libvirt/qemu
	* src/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu_conf.h: Load user/group from config
	* src/qemu_driver.c: Change user ID/group ID when launching QEMU
	  guests. Change user/group ownership on disks/usb/pci devs.
	  Put memory dumps in %localstatedir/cache/libvirt/qemu
	* src/util.c, src/util.h: Add convenient APIs for converting
	  username/groupname to user ID / group ID

2009-07-16  Laine Stump  <laine@laine.org>

	Implement the new virinterface functions
	* src/driver.h: add new driver functions virDrvNumOfDefinedInterfaces
	  and virDrvListDefinedInterfaces
	* src/libvirt.c: implements the entry points, calling new driver
	  functions
	* qemud/remote.c qemud/remote_dispatch_args.h qemud/remote_protocol.[chx]
	  qemud/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h qemud/remote_dispatch_ret.h
	  qemud/remote_dispatch_table.h src/remote_internal.c: implement the
	  client/server side of the RPC

	Public API for new virInterface functions
	* include/libvirt/libvirt.h[.in]: adds signatures for the new exported
	  functions virConnectNumOfDefinedInterfaces and
	  virConnectListDefinedInterfaces
	* src/libvirt_public.syms: export the new symbols

2009-07-16  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Fix configure flags in spec file
	* libvirt.spec.in: we were still using deprecated configure switches

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rename a bunch of internal methods to clarify their meaning
	This renames a lot of the methods in the remote driver client
	to more accurately reflect their responsibility of IO handling
	vs message handling.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Simplify remote driver error reporting
	Remove redundant error reporting functions which obscured the
	filename/line number reporting. Removed code which created a
	virDomain/virNetwork object, since those are silently dropped
	in error reporting functions now

	* src/remote_internal.c: Remove error() and errorf() in favour of
	 macros, and remove server_error in favour of direct call

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor message sending to allow code reuse for data streams
	Splits up the 'call' method moving generic IO code out into
	separate method to allow it to be easily reused for sending
	data streams

	* src/remote_internal.c: Split 'call' into two methods, the first
	  with same name serializes a set of method arguments into a
	  message, the second 'remoteIO' takes a pre-serialized messages,
	  sends it and awaits a reply

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Refactor incoming message handling to prepare for data stream support
	* src/remote_internal.c: Rename processCallRecvMsg to
	  processCallDispatch, and move code specific to method replies
	  into processCallDispatchReply, and rename processCallAsyncEvent
	  to processCallDispatchMessage

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Rename 'direction' to 'type' in remote_message_header
	The 'remote_message_header' struct has a mis-leadingly named
	field 'direction'. It is really a reflection of the type of
	message, and some types can be sent in either direction. Thus
	the field is more accurately named 'type'. No function change.

	* qemud/remote_protocol.x: Rename 'direction' to 'type' in
	  'remote_message_header. Write better docs describing the
	  message header field semantics & usage
	* qemud/remote_protocol.c, qemud/remote_protocol.h: Regenerate
	* qemud/remote.c, qemud/dispatch.c, src/remote_internal.c
	  Update to reflect rename of 'direction' to 'type'

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Define an API for registering incoming message dispatch filters
	All incoming messages currently get routed to the generic method
	remoteDispatchClientRequest() for processing. To allow incoming
	data stream messages to bypass this and be routed to a specific
	location, a concept of dispatch filters is introduced.

	* qemud/qemud.h: Add a qemud_client_filter struct and a callback
	  qemud_client_filter_func. Maintain a list of filters on every
	  struct qemud_client
	* qemud/qemud.c: Move remoteDecodeClientMessageHeader() out of
	  qemudWorker() into qemudDispatchClientRead(). Check registered
	  message filters in qemudDispatchClientRead() to decide where
	  to send incoming messages for dispatch.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split out code for handling incoming method call messages
	The remoteDispatchClientRequest() method is currently hardwired to
	assume there is only one type of incoming message, a method call.
	To allow for alternate types of incoming messags, the code that is
	specific to method calls is being split into a separate method
	remoteDispatchClientCall

	* qemud/dispatch.c: Move method call specific code out into
	  remoteDispatchClientCall. Add a helper remoteSerializeError
	  for returning error messages to client

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Change the way client event loop watches are managed
	The current qemudRegisterClientEvent() code is used both for
	registering the initial socket watch, and updating the already
	registered watch. This causes unneccessary complexity in alot
	of code which only cares about updating existing watches. The
	updating of a watch cannot ever fail, nor is a reference to the
	'qemud_server' object required.

	This introduces a new qemudUpdateClientEvent() method for that
	case, allowing the elimination of unneccessary error checking
	and removal of the server back-reference in struct qemud_client.

	* qemud/qemud.h: Remove 'server' field from struct qemud_client.
	  Add qemudUpdateClientEvent() method. Remove 'update' param
	  from qemudRegisterClientEvent method
	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/qemud.c, qemud/remote.c: Update alot
	  of code to use qemudUpdateClientEvent() instead of
	  qemudRegisterClientEvent(). Move more logic from remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  into remoteDispatchDomainEventSend.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Move queuing of RPC replies into dispatch code
	This removes an assumption from qemudWorker() code that every
	incoming message will generate a reply.

	* qemud/dispatch.c: remoteDispatchClientRequest now has responsibility
	  for queuing the reply message to the RPC call
	* qemud/qemud.c: Do not queue the RPC call reply in qemudWorker(),
	  allowing remoteDispatchClientRequest() to take care of it

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Change code generator to give async event messages their own postfix
	The naming convention for structs used in the RPC layer is for
	incoming requests to be called XXXX_args, and the associated
	outgoing reply to be called XXXX_ret.  Asynchronously emitted
	messages (eg events) are re-using the XXXX_ret naming scheme.
	This patch changes that such that async messages are XXXX_msg,
	and stops adding entries for them in the dispatch table, avoiding
	the need for a dummy no-op implementation.

	* qemud/remote.c: Remove dummy remoteDispatchDomainEvent, no
	  longer required. Update to replace remote_domain_event_ret
	  with xdr_remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_protocol.x: Rename remote_domain_event_ret to
	  remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_generate_stubs.pl: Adding handling for new
	  XXX_msg structs.
	* src/remote_internal.c: Rename remote_domain_event_ret to
	  remote_domain_event_msg
	* qemud/remote_dispatch_prototypes.h, qemud/remote_dispatch_ret.h,
	  qemud/remote_dispatch_table.h, qemud/remote_protocol.h,
	  qemud/remote_protocol.c: auto-regenerate

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Separate code for encoding outgoing remote message headers
	Introduces an API for encoding the header field for outgoing messages
	allowing some duplicated code to be eliminated

	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: add remoteEncodeClientMessageHeader
	  for encoding message header. Update remoteDispatchClientRequest to
	  use this method.
	* qemud/remote.c: Update remoteDispatchDomainEventSend to use the
	  generic remoteEncodeClientMessageHeader() for encoding event
	  message hedaders. Push some logic from remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  down into remoteDispatchDomainEventSend.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Decode incoming request header before invoking dispatch code
	Separate the decoding of incoming request header out from the
	dispatch code. This will allow later code to making dispatcher
	routing decisions based on the header field data.

	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: Add remoteDecodeClientMessageHeader
	  API for decoding the header of a client message. Update the
	  remoteDispatchClientRequest method to assume a pre-decoded
	  header.
	* qemud/qemud.h: Include a 'remote_message_header' field in
	  'struct qemud_client_message' for pre-decoded header data
	* qemud/qemud.c: Decode the incoming client message header before
	  invoking remoteDispatchClientRequest

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Split generic RPC message dispatch code out from remote protocol API handlers
	* po/POTFILES.in: Add qemud/dispatch.c
	* qemud/dispatch.c, qemud/dispatch.h: Generic code handling dispatch of
	  RPC messages.
	* qemud/Makefile.am: Add dispatch.c to build
	* qemud/qemud.c: Include dispatch.h
	* qemud/qemud.h: Remove remoteDispatchClientRequest, remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  now in dispatch.h
	* qemud/remote.c: Remove remoteDispatchClientRequest, remoteRelayDomainEvent
	  now in dispatch.c, and dispatch_args, dispatch_ret, dispatch_fn & dispatch_data
	  now in remote.h
	* qemud/remote.h: Add typedefs for dispatch_args, dispatch_ret,
	  dispatch_fn, dispath_data. Add remoteGetDispatchData() API

2009-07-16  Paolo Bonzini  <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	Implement qemu dump capabilities
	* src/qemu_driver.c (qemudDomainCoreDump): New
	  (qemuDriver): Add core dump function. The behaviour is similar
	  as the current Xen dump

	* src/virsh.c: adds cd and pwd commands to virsh useful for save and
	  restore commands
	* docs/virsh.pod virsh.1: update the documentation
	* AUTHORS: add Paolo Bonzini

2009-07-16  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	make "make syntax-check" consistent with "git diff --check"
	This makes "make syntax-check" fail when a version-controlled
	file contains a trailing blank line.
	* cfg.mk (sc_prohibit_trailing_blank_lines): New rule.

	remove all trailing blank lines
	by running this command:
	git ls-files -z | xargs -0 perl -pi -0777 -e 's/\n\n+$/\n/'
	This is in preparation for a more strict make syntax-check
	rule that will detect trailing blank lines.

2009-07-16  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix free of unitialized data upon PCI open fail

	Fix SELinux denial during hotplug
	* src/qemu_driver.c: Relabel disk images *before* running QEMU
	hotplug monitor commands

	Fix PCI device hotplug/unplug with newer QEMU
	* src/qemu_driver.c: Try new monitor syntax for hotplug first. If
	  that fails fallback to old KVM specific syntax

	Fix problem with QEMU monitor welcome prompt confusing libvirt after a libvirtd daemon restart with active guests
	* src/qemu_driver: Read and dicard pending monitor data
	  before issuing new monitor commands.

	Ensure spawned children have a stderr/out set to /dev/null if requested

	Allow autostart of libvirtd to be disabled with LIBVIRT_AUTOSTART=0
	* src/remote_internal.c: Disable libvirtd autostart if the
	  LIBVIRT_AUTOSTART=0 env variable is set
	* src/libvirt.c: Document environment variables can impact
	  the virConnectOpen API

2009-07-16  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	netcf XML validation and input and output tests
	* tests/interfaceschematest: test all XML data against the interface
	  schemas
	* tests/interfacexml2xmltest.c: parse and reserialize all XML data
	  and check the output is identical
	* tests/Makefile.am: hook up the tests
	* tests/.gitignore: add ignore test

	Add netcf XML schemas and test data
	* docs/schemas/interface.rng: schemas for the interface XML files
	  directly imported from netcf-0.1.0
	* tests/interfaceschemadata/*.xml: set of test files from netcf-0.1.0
	  changed to use single quote instead of double quote

	add support for netcf XML import and export

	* src/remote_internal.c: Ensure that all test:/// URIs are dealt
	  with by the auto-started, per-user unprivileged libvirtd instances

	Fix error reporting for security driver over remote protocol
	* qemud/remote.c: Send back the actual libvirt connection error
	  rather than formatting a generic error for security driver
	  methods
	* src/libvirt.c: Fix virDomainGetSecurityLabel, and
	  virNodeGetSecurityModel to correctly set the error on
	  the virConnectPtr object, and raise a full error rather

2009-07-15  Garry Dolley  <gdolley@arpnetworks.com>

	Update the links for RHEL libvirt bugzillas

2009-07-13  Garry Dolley  <gdolley@ucla.edu>

	Update links to bugzilla
	* docs/bugs.html[.in]: general tickets are under the 'Virtualization
	  Tools' product category and Fedora specific tickets are under the
	  'Fedora' product category.

2009-07-11  Cole Robinson  <crobinso@redhat.com>

	Fix docs and code disagreements for character devices.
	The 'pipe' character type wasn't documented.
	TCP uses a <protocol> element, not <wire>
	We weren't doing strict validation for protocol and source mode values.

	qemu: Check driver is initialized up front, to avoid segfault.
	If the qemu_driver was not initialized (possibly due to an error on driver
	startup), we can segfault if attempting to connect to the URI.

2009-07-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: automatically rerun ./bootstrap when needed
	When "git pull" (or any other operation) brings in a new version of the
	gnulib git submodule, you must rerun the autogen.sh script.  With this
	change, "make" now fails and tells you to run ./autogen.sh, when needed.
	* autogen.sh: Maintain a new file, .git-module-status, containing
	the current submodule status.  If it doesn't exist or its content
	is different from what "git submodule status" prints, then run
	./bootstrap
	* .gitignore: Add .git-module-status
	* cfg.mk: Diagnose out of date submodule and fail.
	* README-hacking: Update not to mention bootstrap.
	* Makefile.am (MAINTAINERCLEANFILES): Add .git-module-status,
	so that "make maintainerclean" will remove it.

	build: make autogen.sh use autoreconf -if
	* autogen.sh: Use "autoreconf -if" instead of open-coding it with
	manual and unconditional invocation of each separate tool.

2009-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Use virDomainChrTypeFromString() instead of open coding
	* src/domain_conf.c: replace open coded chr type parsing with
	  virDomainChrTypeFromString(), retaining the existing semantics
	  where unknown types are silently mapped to the "null" type and
	  "pty" is used if none is specified

2009-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Switch to using a unix socket for the qemu monitor
	We keep support for the pty based monitor so that we can re-connect
	to VMs started by older versions of libvirtd.

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle formatting and parsing unix monitors

	* src/qemu_driver.c: add qemudOpenMonitorUnix(), remove the monitor
	  pty path searching from qemudFindCharDevicePTYs(), switch
	  qemudStartVMDaemon() and qemuDomainXMLToNative() to using a unix
	  monitor

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: switch to using a unix monitor

	* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-*.args: update test data

2009-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Add the monitor type to the domain state XML
	There are no functional changes in this patch apart from adding the
	monitor type to the state XML.

	The patch mostly consists of switching to use virDomainChrDef every
	where to describe the monitor.

	* src/domain_conf.h: replace monitorpath with monitor_chr

	* src/domain_conf.c: handle parsing the monitor type and initializing
	  monitor chr

	* src/qemu_conf.[ch]: make qemudBuildCommandLine take a
	  virDomainChrDefPtr and use that to build the -monitor parameter

	* src/qemu_driver.c: split pty specific and common code from
	  qemudOpenMonitor, have qemudStartVMDaemon() initialize monitor_chr

	* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: update for qemudBuildCommandLine() change

2009-07-10  Mark McLoughlin  <markmc@redhat.com>

	Minor qemu monitor coding style fixes
	* src/qemu_driver.c: use a consistent coding style for function
	  definitions

	Don't leak vm->monitorpath on re-connect
	* src/qemu_driver.c: vm->monitorpath is already initialized in the case
	  of re-connect, so move the initialization for the normal startup case
	  out of the common code

2009-07-10  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	build: update from gnulib, for latest maint.mk
	* gnulib: Update submodule to latest.
	This fixes the make syntax-check failure whereby sc_po_check
	would complain about cfg.mk.

	avoid a "make syntax-check" failure
	* .x-sc_avoid_if_before_free: Ignore *all* ChangeLog files,
	now, including ChangeLog-old.

2009-07-09  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Fix wierd build problems due to autopoint overwriting gnulib m4
	* Makefile.am: List -I m4 first, in ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS
	* .gitignore: ignore gnulib/, ChangeLog, *rej, *orig, *#*# (emacs
	  temporary files)

2009-07-09  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	doc: clone+build instructions
	* README-hacking: New file.
	* bootstrap: Remove obsolete comments.

	build: adjust aclocal's search patch to prefer gnulib's m4 files.
	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Search gnulib/m4/ before m4/.

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	generate ChangeLog from git logs into distribution tarball
	No longer maintain a version-controlled ChangeLog file, but do
	continue to include a ChangeLog file in distribution tarball.
	* Makefile.am (gen-ChangeLog): New rule.
	(dist-hook): Depend on it.
	(EXTRA_DIST): Add ChangeLog-old.
	* bootstrap (modules): Add gitlog-to-changelog.
	* ChangeLog: Remove file.  Renamed to...
	* ChangeLog-old: ...this.  New file.
	* autogen.sh: Touch ChangeLog, to ensure it exists.  For automake.

	use gnumakefile and maintainer-makefile modules from gnulib
	* bootstrap (modules): Add gnumakefile and maintainer-makefile.
	* GNUmakefile: Remove file, now provided by gnulib.
	* Makefile.maint: Remove.  Replaced by maint.mk from gnulib.
	.gitignore: Add GNUmakefile and maint.mk.
	* cfg.mk (prev_version_file): Disable this feature.
	Setting this to /dev/null avoids an otherwise harmless diagnostic.

	remove all .cvsignore files

2009-07-08  Jim Meyering  <meyering@redhat.com>

	make .gnulib a submodule
	This makes it so we record (via a git submodule)
	a snapshot of whatever version of gnulib we're using,
	and none of gnulib sources are in the libvirt repository.
	The result is that we have as much reproducibility as when
	we version-controlled imported copies of the gnulib sources,
	but without the hassle of the manual process we used when
	syncing with upstream.

	Note that when you clone libvirt, you get only the libvirt
	repository, but when you first run ./bootstrap, it clones
	gnulib (at the SHA1 recorded via the submodule), creating
	the .gnulib/ hierarchy.  Then, the bootstrap script runs
	gnulib-tool to populate gnulib/ with the files that make
	up the selected modules.

	Put the following in your ~/.gitconfig file.
	[alias]
	  syncsub = submodule foreach git pull origin master

	The update procedure is simple:
	  git syncsub
	  ...build & test...
	  git commit -m 'gnulib: sync submodule to latest' .gnulib

	* .gitmodules: New file.
	* .gnulib: Initialize.
	* bootstrap: Set up to use the new submodule.
	Stop using --no-vc-files.
	Don't remove .gitignore files.
	Don't use or create .cvsignore.
	Diagnose an invalid --gnulib-srcdir=DIR argument.
	* build-aux/vc-list-files: Delete file, now pulled from gnulib.
	* build-aux/useless-if-before-free: Likewise.
	* po/POTFILES.in: Remove gnulib/lib/gai_strerror.c, since
	it no longer contains translatable strings.
	* gnulib/*: Remove gnulib/ hierarchy.

	skip some of gnulib's new rules
	* cfg.mk (local-checks-to-skip): Add these: sc_error_message_uppercase,
	sc_program_name, sc_require_test_exit_idiom, sc_makefile_check.

	Prepare to use maint.mk from gnulib
	Since Makefile.maint will soon come from gnulib's maint.mk,
	sync Makefile.maint to have the same contents (modulo minor
	things).  In syncing it, we have to remove some libvirt-specific
	rules.  Since we want to keep them (of course), put those in cfg.mk.
	* Makefile.maint: Merge from gnulib's maint.mk.
	* cfg.mk (sc_avoid_write): New rule.  From Makefile.cfg.
	(sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp): Likewise, and rename.
	(sc_prohibit_asprintf, sc_prohibit_VIR_ERR_NO_MEMORY): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_nonreentrant): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_ctype_h): Likewise.
	(sc_TAB_in_indentation, sc_avoid_ctype_macros): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_virBufferAdd_with_string_literal): Likewise.
	(sc_prohibit_gethostby): Likewise.
	(sc_libvirt_unmarked_diagnostics): Likewise.  Also, rename the
	rule, inserting "_libvirt", since this rule is a specialization of
	the one in gnulib.
	* GNUmakefile: Include cfg.mk, not Makefile.cfg
	* .x-sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp: New file.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add .x-sc_prohibit_strcmp_and_strncmp

	* Makefile.cfg: Rename to...
	* cfg.mk: ...this.  New file.

	use automake-1.11's silent-rules option, when possible
	Don't use mylibtool, (subsumed by automake's silent rules)
	Its use was causing a non-srcdir build to fail.
	* Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Remove mylibtool.
	* configure.in: Don't use mylibtool.

	* configure.in: Use AM_SILENT_RULES([yes]),
	but only if that m4 macro is defined.
	Thus, it works even on systems that lack automake-1.11.
	Daniel Berrange suggested adding the conditional, so that
	we don't have a hard requirement on 1.11, e.g., for RHEL5.

	fix another failing "make distcheck" (qemuhelptest)
	It failed in a non-srcdir build because those 5 sample output
	files were not included in the distribution tarball.  Include them.
	* tests/Makefile.am (qemuhelpdata, EXTRA_DIST): Include these:
	kvm-74, kvm-86, qemu-0.10.5, qemu-0.9.1, qemu-kvm-0.10.5.

	fix failing "make distcheck"
	* docs/Makefile.am (xml): Distribute testpool.xml and testvol.xml,
	which are referenced from testnode.xml.

2009-07-08  Daniel P. Berrange  <berrange@redhat.com>

	Make it easier to debug tests running programs
		* tests/testutils.c: Don't discard stderr when running
		external programs during tests

	Support <video> element for QEMU guests
		* src/qemu_conf.c, src/qemu_conf.h: Use -vga or -std-vga
		when starting guests if video card is present
		* tests/qemuhelptest.c: Change to use constants instead
		of hardcoded hex numbers, and add VGA support
		* tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-sdl-fullscreen.xml,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-sdl.args,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-sdl.xml,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-vnc-sasl.args,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-vnc-sasl.xml,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-vnc-tls.xml,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-graphics-vnc.xml,
		tests/qemuxml2argvdata/qemuxml2argv-input-xen.xml: Add <video>
		element for testing graphics adapter
		* tests/qemuxml2argvtest.c: Add QEMUD_CMD_FLAG_VGA flag
		* tests/qemuxml2xmltest.c: Add missing graphics-vnc-sasl/tls tests

	Support <video> tag for defining VGA card properties
	 * docs/schemas/domain.rng: Define <video> element schema
	 * src/domain_conf.c, src/domain_conf.h, src/libvirt_private.syms:
	   Add parsing and formatting for <video> element

	Report the object name on lookup error
	* src/network_driver.c src/node_device.c src/storage_driver.c:
	  many places in the code reported 'No xxx with matching name" after
	  a Lookup error without reporting the name used by the failed lookup

2009-07-08  Harshavardhana  <harsha@gluster.com>

	Add new net filesystem glusterfs
	* src/storage_conf.c src/storage_conf.h: adds glusterfs to the list
	  of network storage
	* libvirt.spec.in: adds the dependency on glusterfs-client

2009-07-07  Paolo Bonzini  <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	Avoid raising an internal error
	* src/qemu_conf.c: when connecting an interface if it reference
	  an undefined network, then we used to raise an internal error.

2009-07-07  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	Fix informations about previous git server
	* docs/downloads.html[.in]: update the secton about
	the server on git.et.redhat.com based on the plans
	Jim posted.

	Fix python examples to use read-write conn
	* docs/examples/python/domstart.py python/tests/create.py:
	The two example were broken as they needed full-access connection
	but only opened read-only connections

2009-07-06  Daniel Veillard  <veillard@redhat.com>

	update download informations after switch to git * docs/downloads.html docs/downloads.html.in: update download   informations after switch to git daniel
