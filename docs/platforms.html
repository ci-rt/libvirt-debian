        <h1>Supported host platforms</h1>
        <ul/>
        <h2>Build targets</h2>
        <p>
      Libvirt drivers aim to support building and executing on multiple
      host OS platforms. This document outlines which platforms are the
      major build targets. These platforms are used as the basis for deciding
      upon the minimum required versions of 3rd party software libvirt depends
      on. If a platform is not listed here, it does not imply that libvirt
      won't work. If an unlisted platform has comparable software versions
      to a listed platform, there is every expectation that it will work.
      Bug reports are welcome for problems encountered on unlisted platforms
      unless they are clearly older vintage than what is described here.
    </p>
        <p>
      Note that when considering software versions shipped in distros as
      support targets, libvirt considers only the version number, and assumes
      the features in that distro match the upstream release with the same
      version. In other words, if a distro backports extra features to the
      software in their distro, libvirt upstream code will not add explicit
      support for those backports, unless the feature is auto-detectable in
      a manner that works for the upstream releases too.
    </p>
        <p>
      The Repology site is a useful resource to identify currently shipped
      versions of software in various operating systems, though it does not
      cover all distros listed below.

        </ul>
        <h3>Linux OS</h3>
        <p>
      For distributions with frequent, short-lifetime releases, the project
      will aim to support all versions that are not end of life by their
      respective vendors. For the purposes of identifying supported software
      versions, the project will look at Fedora, Ubuntu, and openSUSE distros.
      Other short-lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar software
      versions.
    </p>
        <p>
      For distributions with long-lifetime releases, the project will aim to
      support the most recent major version at all times. Support for the
      previous major version will be dropped 2 years after the new major
      version is released. For the purposes of identifying supported software
      versions, the project will look at RHEL, Debian, Ubuntu LTS, and SLES
      distros. Other long-lifetime distros will be assumed to ship similar
      software versions.
    </p>
        <h3>Windows</h3>
        <p>
      The project supports building with current versions of the MinGW
      toolchain, hosted on Linux.
    </p>
        <h3>macOS</h3>
        <p>
      The project supports building with the current version of macOS,
      with the current homebrew package set available.
    </p>
        <h3>FreeBSD</h3>
        <p>
      The project aims to support the most recent major version
      at all times. Support for the previous major version will
      be dropped 2 years after the new major version is released.
    </p>
        <h2>Virtualization platforms</h2>
        <p>
      For <a href="drivers.html">hypervisor drivers</a> which execute
      locally (QEMU, LXC, VZ, libxl, etc), the set of supported operating
      system platforms listed above will inform choices as to the minimum
      required versions of 3rd party libraries and hypervisor management
      APIs.
    </p>
        <p>
      If a hypervisor is not commonly shipped directly by any distro
      listed above, (VMware ESX, HyperV, VZ), the project aims to
      support versions up to 5 years, or until the vendor discontinues
      support, whichever comes first.
