        <h3>
          <strong>v4.5.0 (2018-07-02)</strong>
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
          qemu: Provide TPM emulator support
        <br/>
          Support QEMU's TPM emulator based on swtpm. Each QEMU guest gets
          its own virtual TPM.
        </li>
              <li>
          bhyve: Support specifying guest CPU topology
        <br/>
          Bhyve's guest CPU topology could be specified using the
          <code>&lt;cpu&gt;&lt;topology ../&gt;&lt;/cpu&gt;</code> element.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for extended TSEG size
        <br/>
          Support specifying extended TSEG size for SMM in QEMU.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for SEV guests
        <br/>
          SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is a feature available on AMD
          CPUs that encrypts the guest memory and makes it inaccessible even
          to the host OS.
        </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Removed features</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
          Remove support for qcow/default encrypted volumes
        <br/>
          Disallow using a qcow encrypted volume for the guest and
          disallow creation of the qcow or default encrypted volume
          from the storage driver. Support for qcow encrypted volumes
          has been phasing out since QEMU 2.3 and by QEMU 2.9 creation
          of a qcow encrypted volume via qemu-img required usage of
          secret objects, but that support was never added to libvirt.
        </li>
              <li>
          Make GnuTLS mandatory
        <br/>
          Building without GnuTLS is no longer possible.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Remove allow_disk_format_probing configuration option
        <br/>
          The option represented a security risk when used with malicious
          disk images, so users were recommended against enabling it; with
          this release, it's been removed altogether.
        </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Improvements</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
          capabilities: Provide info about host IOMMU support
        <br/>
          Capabilities XML now provide information about host IOMMU support.
        </li>
              <li>
          virsh: Add --all to domblkinfo command
        <br/>
          Alter the <code>domblkinfo</code> command to add the option
          --all in order to display the size details of each domain
          block device from one command in a output table.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Allow concurrent access to monitor and guest agent
        <br/>
          Historically libvirt prevented concurrent accesses to
          the qemu monitor and the guest agent. Therefore two
          independent calls (one querying the monitor and the
          other querying guest agent) would serialize which hurts
          performance. The code was reworked to allow two
          independent calls run at the same time.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Allow configuring the page size for HPT pSeries guests
        <br/>
          For HPT pSeries guests, the size of the host pages used to back guest
          memory and the usable guest page sizes are connected; the new setting
          can be used to request that a certain page size is available in the
          guest.
        </li>
              <li>
          Add support to use an raw input volume for encryption
        <br/>
          It is now possible to provide a raw input volume as input for
          to generate a luks encrypted volume via either virsh vol-create-from
          or virStorageVolCreateXMLFrom.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for vsock hot (un)plug and cold (un)plug
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for NBD over TLS
        <br/>
          NBD volumes can now be accessed securely.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Implement FD passing for Unix sockets
        <br/>
          Instead of having QEMU open the socket and then connecting to it,
          which is inherently racy, starting with QEMU 2.12 we can open the
          socket ourselves and pass it to QEMU, avoiding race conditions.
        </li>
              <li>
          virsh: Introduce --nowait option for domstat command
        <br/>
          When this option is specified, virsh will try to fetch the guest
          stats but abort instead of stalling if they can't be retrieved right
          away.
        </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Bug fixes</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
          qemu: Fix a potential libvirtd crash on VM reconnect
        <br/>
          Initialization of the driver worker pool needs to come before libvirtd
          trying to reconnect to all machines, since one of the QEMU processes
          migh have already emitted events which need to be handled prior to
          us getting to the worker pool initialization.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Fix domain resume after failed migration
        <br/>
          Recent versions of QEMU activate block devices before the guest CPU
          has been started, which makes it impossible to roll back a failed
          migration. Use the <code>late-block-activate</code> migration
          capability if supported to avoid the issue.
        </li>
              <li>
          vmx: Permit guests to have an odd number of vCPUs
        <br/>
          An odd number of vCPUs greater than 1 was forbidden in the past,
          but current versions of ESXi have lifted that restriction.
        </li>
            </ul>

        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>New features</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
          bhyve: Support locking guest memory
        <br/>
          Bhyve's guest memory may be wired using the
          <code>&lt;memoryBacking&gt;&lt;locked/&gt;&lt;/memoryBacking&gt;</code>
          element.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Provide VFIO channel I/O passthrough support
        <br/>
          Support passthrough devices that use channel I/O based mechanism in
          a QEMU virtual machine.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for migration of VMs with non-shared storage over TLS
        <br/>
          It's now possible to use the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag together with
          VIR_MIGRATE_NON_SHARED_DISK. The connection is then secured using the
          TLS environment which is setup for the migration connection.
        </li>
              <li>
          Add support for VM Generation ID
        <br/>
          The VM Generatation ID exposes a 128-bit, cryptographically
          random, integer value identifier, referred to as a Globally
          Unique Identifier (GUID) to the guest in order to notify the
          guest operating system when the virtual machine is executed
          with a different configuration. Add a new domain XML processing
          and a domain capabilities feature.
        </li>
              <li>
          Introduce virDomainDetachDeviceAlias
        <br/>
          This new API enables users to detach device using only its alias.
        </li>
              <li>
          Introduce new virConnectCompareHypervisorCPU and virConnectBaselineHypervisorCPU APIs
        <br/>
          Unlike the old virConnectCompareCPU and virConnectBaselineCPU APIs,
          both new APIs consider capabilities of a specific hypervisor.
        </li>
              <li>
          Introduce SCSI persistent reservations support
        <br/>
          The QEMU driver gained support for qemu-pr-helper which enables
          guests to issue SCSI commands for persistent reservation.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Implement multiple screen support for virDomainScreenshot
        <br/>
          While the virDomainScreenshot API supported multihead video cards,
          the implementation was missing. But now that QEMU implemented it
          libvirt has done as well.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: add support for vhost-vsock-device
        <br/>
          A new vsock device was introduced, allowing communication between
          the guest and the host via the AF_VSOCK family.
        </li>

              <li>
          qemu: Add suport for OpenGL rendering with SDL
        <br/>
          Domains using SDL as a graphics backend will now be able to use
          OpenGL accelerated rendering.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Add support for 'output' audio codec
        <br/>
          Support QEMU's 'hda-output' codec advertising only a line-out for ich6
          and ich9 sound devices.
        </li>
              <li>
          virsh: Enhance event name completion
        <br/>
          Implement event name completion for some commands (e.g. event,
          secret-event, pool-event and nodedev-event)

        <br/>
          Pure PCIe guests such as x86_64/q35 and aarch64/virt will now
          add this controller when traditional PCI devices are in use.

          Xen: Support setting CPU features for host-passthrough model
        <br/>
          The CPU model presented to Xen HVM domains is equivalent to libvirt's
          host-passthrough model, although individual features can be enabled
          and disabled via the cpuid setting. The libvirt libxl driver now
          supports enabling and disabling individual features of the
          host-passthrough CPU model.

          Xen: Drop the legacy xend-based driver
        <br/>
          The xm/xend toolstack was deprecated in Xen 4.2 and removed
          from the Xen sources in the 4.5 development cycle. The libvirt
          driver based on xend is now removed from the libvirt sources.

          qemu: Support hot plug and hot unplug of mediated devices
        <br/>
          Libvirt now allows mediated devices to be hot plugged and hot
          unplugged from a guest rather than reporting an error that this isn't
          supported. In fact, kernel has been supporting this since 4.10.

          Improve handling of device mapper targets
        <br/>
          When starting a domain with a disk backed by a device
          mapper volume libvirt also needs to allow the storage
          backing the device mapper in CGroups. In the past
          kernel did not care, but starting from 4.16 CGroups are
          consulted on each access to the device mapper target.

          Support building with Python 3
        <br/>
          Python is required to build libvirt, and up until now only Python 2
          could be used as an interpreter. All scripts used during build have
          now been made compatible with Python 3, which means both major
          releases of the language are fully supported.

          Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight
        <br/>
          The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain
          scheduler weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided
          <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;cputune&gt;</code>. The
          driver now honors <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code>, and defers setting
          a default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any
          domains started after this improvement will have one fourth the
          shares of previously started domains. If all domains must have
          equal CPU shares, administrators must manually set the weight of
          previously started domains to 256, or restart them.

          qemu: TLS migration now enforces use of TLS for the NBD connection
        <br/>
          When the VIR_MIGRATE_TLS flag was used with the migration API libvirt
          did not ensure that the NBD connection was using TLS as well. The code
          now rejects such migration as the TLS transport for NBD is not ready
          yet, but prevents a false sense of security that TLS would be used.

          Added support for CAT (Cache allocation Technology)
        <br/>
          Domain vCPU threads can now have allocated some parts of host cache
          using the <code>cachetune</code> element in <code>cputune</code>.

              <li>
          Allow opening secondary drivers
        <br/>
          Up until now it was possible to connect to only hypervisor drivers
          (e.g. qemu:///system, lxc:///, vbox:///system, and so on). The
          internal drivers (like network driver, node device driver, etc.) were
          hidden from users and users could use them only indirectly. Starting
          with this release new connection URIs are accepted. For instance
          network:///system, storage:///system and so on.

        <br/>
          Implement more bash completions so that basic libvirt
          objects can be auto-completed (e.g. networks,
          interfaces, NWFilters, and so on).

          qemu: Allow showing the dump progress for memory only dump
        <br/>
          Alter the QEMU dump-guest-memory command processing to check
          for and allow asynchronous completion which then allows for
          the virsh dump --memory-only --verbose command to display percent
          completion data.

              <li>
          Make port allocator global
        <br/>
          Up until now each driver had their own port allocator module. This
          meant that info on port usage was not shared. Starting with this
          release, the port allocator module is made global and therefore
          drivers allocate ports from global pool.

              <li>
          qemu: Check for unsafe migration more thoroughly
        <br/>
          If a domain disk is stored on local filesystem (e.g. ext4) but is
          not being migrated it is very likely that domain is not able to
          run on destination. Regardless of share/cache mode.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Fix updating device with boot order
        <br/>
          Starting with 3.7.0 release updating any device with boot order would
          fail with 'boot order X is already used by another device' while in
          fact it was the very same device.
        </li>
              <li>
          virlog: determine the hostname on startup CVE-2018-6764
        <br/>
          At later point it might not be possible or even safe to use
          getaddrinfo(). It can in turn result in a load of NSS module which
          can even be loaded from unsage guest filesystem and thus escape the
          confinment of its container.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Rework vCPU statistics fetching
        <br/>
          Fetching vCPU statistics was very expensive because it lead to waking
          up vCPU threads in QEMU and thus it degraded performance. The code
          was reworked so that fetching statistics does not wake up halted
          vCPUs.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: unlink memory backing file on domain shutdown
        <br/>
          Depending on the filesystem where domain memory is stored, some files
          might have been left behind. This is not a problem on hugetlbfs, but
          it is a problem on regular filesystems like ext4.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Fix shutting down domains in parallel
        <br/>
          If multiple domains were being shut down in parallel, libvirtd might
          have deadlocked.
        </li>
              <li>
          nodedev: Update PCI mdev capabilities dynamically
        <br/>
          PCI devices may have other nested capabilities, like SRIOV and mdev
          which depend on the device being plugged into the native vendor
          driver. However, in case such a device is directly assigned to a guest
          using VFIO driver, the device will naturally lose these capabilities
          and libvirt needs to reflect that.

          conf: Support defining distances between virtual NUMA cells
        <br/>
          A NUMA hardware architecture supports the notion of distances
          between NUMA cells. This can now be specified using the
          <code>&lt;distances&gt;</code> element within the NUMA cell
          configuration. Drivers which support this include Xen and QEMU.

          qemu: Add the ability to configure HPT resizing for pSeries guests
        <br/>
          The user can now decide whether HPT (Hash Page Table) resizing
          should be enabled, disabled or required instead of leaving it up to
          hypervisor defaults and negotiation between the guest and the host.
        </li>

          Starting with QEMU 2.11, the guest can save kernel debug
          details when this feature is enabled and the kernel supports
          it. It is useful to process kernel dump with KASLR enabled,

          vbox: Add support for configuring storage controllers
        <br/>
          The VirtualBox driver now supports the <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code>
          element in the domain XML for configuring storage controllers in VBOX
          VMs.  Additionally, libvirt's domain XML schema was updated to allow
          optional <code>model</code> attribute for <code>&lt;controller
              type='ide'&gt;</code> which is used by the VBOX driver to set the
          IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
          'ich6'.  Finally, with this change <code>dumpxml</code> generates
          <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code> elements that correspond to current
          VBOX VM storage controller configuration.
        </li>
              <li>
          vbox: Add support for attaching empty removable disks
        <br/>
          The VirutalBox driver now supports adding CD-ROM and floppy disk
          devices that do not have the disk source specified. Previously such
          devices were silently ignored.
        </li>
              <li>
          vbox: Add support for attaching SAS storage controllers
        <br/>
          In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas
          libvirt does not make such distinction. Therefore, the VBOX driver was
          updated to allow attaching SAS controllers via <code>&lt;controller
              type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'&gt;</code> element. If there are
          both SCSI and SAS controllers present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML
          can associate the disk device using the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
          element with the <code>controller</code> attribute, and optionally,
          set the port via <code>unit</code> attribute.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Generate predictable paths for qemu memory backends
        <br/>
          In some cases management applications need to know
          paths passed to memory-backend-file objects upfront.
          Libvirt now generates predictable paths so applications
          can prepare the files if they need to do so.
        </li>
              <li>
          Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu
        <br/>
          Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption
          of disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the
          feature was turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing
          of those disks in qemu so that the image locking is not applied in
          that case. Additionally libvirt now checks that shareable disks have
          supported format (raw) to avoid metadata corruption.
        </li>
              <li>
          Improve serial console behavior on non-x86 architectures
        <br/>
          ppc64, aarch64 and s390x guests were treating the &lt;serial&gt;
          and &lt;console&gt; elements differently from x86, in some cases
          presenting misleading information to the user. The behavior is now
          consistent across all architectures and the information reported
          is always accurate.

          The <code>define</code> now fails and reports an error if any of the

          domain XML fail to attach to the VirtualBox VM.

          The VirtualBox driver was ignoring any disk devices in

          attached to the VM.
        </li>
              <li>
          vbox: Fix dumpxml to always generate valid domain XML
        <br/>
          When a VirtualBox VM has multiple disks attached, each to a different
          storage controller that uses 'sd' prefix for block device names e.g.
          one disk attached to SATA and one to SCSI controller, it no longer
          generates XML where both would have 'sda' device name assigned.
          Instead it properly assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the
          order of appearance.

          secret object to securely pass the authentication data.

          A logical volume may be created using an <code>encryption</code>

          <code>secret</code> to store the passphrase used to encrypt the

          If the MAC address has not been specified by the user, libvirt will
          try and fill in the gaps by generating one; however, for some error
          paths that led to some confusing error messages, so when an
          auto-generated MAC address is specified the error message will not
          include the auto-generated MAC.

          libvirt will now obtain the (dynamically allocated) RDP port number
          from VirtualBox itself, avoiding conflicts between multiple guests
          wanting to use RDP at the same time.

          qemu: Allow rotation of small logs
        <br/>
          On a host where numerous unique instances are executed per day, it's
          quite possible that, even though each of the single log files are
          fairly small, collectively the quantity and volume may add tens of
          thousands of log files to the <code>/var/log/libvirt/qemu/</code>
          directory. Removing the constraints that log have to be bigger than
          100 KiB before they can be rotated solves the issue.

        <br/>
          Due to internal implementation, reported statistics for
          some types of interfaces were swapped (RX appeared in
          TX and vice versa). Similarly, QoS was set in reversed
          way.

          Failing to do so causes the addresses to be considered usable by

          While it's reasonable to turn off client certificate validation,
          as setting it up can be non-trivial, clients should always verify
          the server certificate to avoid MITM attacks. However, libvirt was
          using the same knob to control both checks, leading to

          Starting with QEMU 2.10, disk images and NVRAM files get
          automatically locked to prevent them from being corrupted; however,
          file locking needs to be explicitly allowed through

          There were some issues with multi-byte domains getting lost

          qemu: Support long domain names with namespaces

          For some time libvirt required qemu capabilities being present when

          fail to parse and thus vanish, if the emulator binary would be

          vCPU properties gathered from query-hotpluggable-cpus need to be

          original and updated CPU definition in order to support migration
          to older libvirt/QEMU versions. Only the updated CPU definition
          was sent to destination.

          Repository now has new README.md file
        <br/>
          The new file uses markdown syntax, so it looks better on
          github and possibly other web pages, but it has also more
          useful information. The old README is now symlink to the

          qemu: Use GICv2 by default for aarch64/virt TCG guests
        <br/>
          The emulated GICv3 has some limitations that make it unusable as a
          default; use GICv2 until they're sorted out. This change makes it
          once again possible to run aarch64/virt guests on a x86_64 host
          without having to tweak their configuration.

              <li>
          Additional capabilities for the node_device module
        <br/>
          Introduce two new capabilities to the node_device module. The first
          is for CCW devices, most common on the S390 architecture. The second
          is for fibre channel-backed SCSI devices and exposes the
          fc_remote_port sub-capability to SCSI target devices.
        </li>
              <li>
          Node devices now report Mediated device capabilities
        <br/>
          Endpoint devices support new <code>mdev</code> capability
          and their parents now report the supported types in new
          <code>mdev_types</code> capability.
        </li>
              <li>
          Capabilities now report information about host caches
        <br/>
          If supported in the kernel, host capabilities will now list
          L3 caches. The code for other levels was added as well, but
          only L3 caches are reported currently.

          they were not saved in the XML. It is now possible to see
          and control the listen addresses properly.
        </li>
              <li>
          Default USB controllers are now added for devices in libxl domains
        <br/>
          Even though they were added automatically when USB device
          was attached, they could've been missing in some other
          cases. The logic is now fixed so there are always USB
          controllers, even if there was none of them in the specified
          XML.
        </li>
              <li>

          Hitting the RPC limits we have is easier every day, so they

          improved as well. It is now possible to get more stats than
          ever using the <code>virConnectGetAllDomainStats()</code>
          call and push through even bigger requests and replies for
          all APIs.

          qemu: Create memory_backing_dir on startup

          PCIe 4.0 cards now report proper link speeds
        <br/>
          It could happen that the link speed for PCIe devices was not
          properly reported or the nodedev-dumpxml just failed. That
          was due to mistake in the field width, but should now work

          there was an error message "internal error: End of file from
          qemu monitor" in the logs even though no problem happened.
          The detection of these false positives was improved and such

          User-specified UNIX socket paths for virtio channels should not be reset

          It could happen, in some cases, that libvirt would mistake a
          user-specified path for its own generated one and thus
          remove it from the XML. The detection of such addresses was
          improved now.

        <br/>
          When error occurred in a specific point in time during the
          hot-plug of an RNG device, it could happen that an address
          was released even though another device was already using
          it, making it possible to hot-plug another device with that
          address, effectively having duplicated addresses in the XML.

          NVDIMM is new type of memory introduced into QEMU 2.6. The idea is
          that we have a non-volatile memory module that keeps the data
          persistent across domain reboots and offers much faster data

          For new controllers, a generic device (pcie-root-port) will be used

          the QEMU binary supports it.

          qemu: Add support for checking guest CPU ABI compatibility
        <br/>
          When migrating a domain to a different host, restoring a domain from
          a file or reverting a snapshot libvirt will make sure the guest CPU
          QEMU presents to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on
          the source host (or before the domain's state was saved). This
          enhanced check may also be requested when starting a new domain to

          Recent kernel version introduced new mediated device framework, so
          provide an initial support of this framework for libvirt, mainly by
          introducing a new host device type in the XML.

          Add support for block device threshold event
        <br/>
          When using thin provisioning, management tools need to resize the
          disk in certain cases. To avoid having them to poll disk usage
          this version introduces an event which will be fired when a given
          offset of the storage is written by the hypervisor. Together with the
          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

          so non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without
          using an external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also
          supported now, allowing to connect to guests via VNC and use
          an USB tablet as an input device. Please refer to

          qemu: Detect host CPU model by asking QEMU on x86_64
        <br/>
          Previously, libvirt detected the host CPU model using CPUID
          instruction, which caused libvirt to detect a lot of CPU features
          that are not supported by QEMU/KVM. Asking QEMU makes sure we
          don't start it with unsupported features.

          debugging.

          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor
        <br/>
          When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor
          socket which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30
          second timeout after which the qemu process was killed. This
          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

        <br/>
          fabric_name is one of many fc_host attributes in Linux that is
          optional and left to the low-level driver to decide if it is
          implemented. For example the zfcp device driver does not provide a
          fabric name for an fcp host. The requirement for the existence of
          a fabric name has been removed by making it optional.
        </li>
              <li>
          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        <br/>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

          as the ability to hotplug devices and improved performance.
          While opting in to virtio-pci has been possible for a while,

          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by

          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from

          for vHBA/NPIV scsi_host creation. Rather than supplying the
          "parent" by name, it's now possible to define the parent by

          qemu: aggregate pcie-root-ports onto multiple functions of a slot
        <br/>
          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.

          The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the
          container scope. As a result, if systemd reloads its config
          after a container is started, when libvirtd is later restarted

          Fix file system storage backend implementation of the OVERWRITE
          flags to be consistent between code and documentation. Add checks
          to ensure that when building a new file system on a target volume
          that there is not something already on the disk in a format that
          libvirt can recognize.
        </li>
              <li>
          qemu: Create hugepage path on per domain basis
        <br/>
          Historically, all hugepage enabled domains shared the same path under
          hugetlbfs. This left libvirt unable to correctly set security labels
          on it. With this release, however, each domain is put into a
          separate path which is also correctly labeled.

        <br/>
          Fixes network interface attach for HVM domains when no model is

          default to the general working scenario.

          By default pae is disabled in libxl. Without an explicit &lt;pae/&gt;
          setting in the domain &lt;features&gt; configuration, an x86_64 HVM
          domain would be get an i686 environment. pae should always be enabled

          Allow debugging of gluster volumes in qemu
        <br/>
          Users can now enable debug logging for native gluster
          volumes in qemu using the "gluster_debug_level" option in qemu.conf

          Pre-allocate memory slots for memory hotplug
        <br/>
          Slot numbers for memory devices are now automatically allocated and
          thus persistent. In addition slot numbers can be specified without
          providing a base address, which simplifies user configuration

          qemu: Express devices will be placed on PCIe bus by default
        <br/>
          For machine types that use a PCI Express root bus
          (e.g. x86_64/Q35 and aarch64/virt), any unaddressed PCI
          device that is an Express device (all virtio-1.0 devices,
          e1000e, nec-xhci, vfio assigned devices) will be placed on
          an Express controller (i.e. a pcie-root-port) instead of a
          legacy PCI controller (i.e. pci-bridge) with the root ports
          added as needed.

          NEWS: Switch to an improved format
        <br/>
          List user-visible changes instead of single commits for a better
          high-level overview of differences between libvirt releases.

          website: Modernize layout and branding
        <br/>
          The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now
          been completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better
          organized and more pleasant to look at.
