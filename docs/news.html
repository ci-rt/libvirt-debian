          Introduce a new video model type that supports the
          <code>bochs-display</code> device that was added in qemu version 3.0.

                  <dd>
          Introduce several new APIs for creating and managing
          checkpoints in the test and qemu drivers (the latter
          requires qcow2 images). Checkpoints serve as a way to tell
          which portions of a disk have changed since a point in time.

          qemu: Add support for overriding max threads per process limit
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          systemd-based systems impose a limit on the number of threads a
          process can spawn, which in some cases can be exceeded by QEMU
          processes running VMs. Add a <code>max_threads_per_process</code>
          option to qemu.conf to override the system default.

          Remember original owners and SELinux labels of files
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          When a domain is starting up libvirt changes DAC and
          SELinux labels so that domain can access it. However,
          it never remembered the original labels and therefore
          the file was returned back to <code>root:root</code>.
          With this release, the original labels are remembered
          and restored properly.

                  <dd>
          This works similarly to the existing support for passing arbitary
          options to QEMU, and just like that feature it comes with no
          support guarantees.

          Add flag <code>VIR_DOMAIN_SNAPSHOT_CREATE_VALIDATE</code> to validate
          snapshot input XML. For virsh, users can use it as <code>virsh

                  <dd>
          A soft TPM backend could be encrypted with passphrase. Now libvirt
          supports using a <code>secret</code> object to hold the passphrase,
          and referring to it via the <code>encryption</code> element of the
          TPM device.

          Implement per-driver locking
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          Drivers now acquire a lock when they're loaded, ensuring that there
          can never be two instances of the same driver active at a time.

          nss: Report newer addresses first
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          In some cases, a guest might be assigned a new IP address by DHCP
          before the previous lease has expired, in which case the NSS plugin
          will correctly report both addresses; many applications, however,
          ignore all addresses but the first, and may thus end up trying to
          connect using a stale address. To prevent that from happening, the
          NSS plugin will now always report the newest address first.

          util: Optimize mass closing of FDs when spawning child processes
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          When the limit on the number of FDs is very high, closing all
          unwanted FDs after calling <code>fork()</code> can take a lot of
          time and delay the start of the child process. libvirt will now
          use an optimized algorithm that minimizes such delays.

          virtlogd implements its own rollover mechanism, but until now
          logrotate could end up acting on the logs before virtlogd had a
          chance to do so itself.

          Most binaries shipped as part of libvirt, for example

          embedding parts of the library even though they also linked against
          the <code>libvirt.so</code> dynamic library. This is no longer the
          case, which results in both the disk and memory footprint being
          reduced.

          Setting the scheduler for QEMU's main thread before QEMU had a chance
          to start up other threads was misleading as it would affect other
          threads (vCPU and I/O) as well.  In some particular situations this
          could also lead to an error when the thread for vCPU #0 was being
          moved to its cpu,cpuacct cgroup.  This was fixed so that the
          scheduler for the main thread is set after QEMU starts.

          running at such priority that could starve the main thread.

          Libvirt allows users to provide loader path for some time now.
          However, this puts some burden on users because they need to
          know what firmware meets their requirements. Now that QEMU
          ships firmware description files this burden can be moved onto
          libvirt. It is as easy as setting the <code>firmware</code>
          attribute in the <code>os</code> element (accepted values are
          <code>bios</code> and <code>efi</code>). Moreover, libvirt
          automatically enables domain features needed for firmware it
          chooses.

          time. This may increase migration speed in case a single thread is
          unable to saturate the network link.

          better user experience when working with GUIs.

          no forward mode) will now be placed in a special firewalld
          zone called "libvirt" by default. The zone of any network
          bridge can be changed using the <code>zone</code> attribute
          of the network's <code>bridge</code> element.

          Historically firewall rules for virtual networks were added
          straight into the base chains. This works but has a number of
          bugs and design limitations. To address them, libvirt now puts
          firewall rules into its own chains. Note that with this change the
          <code>filter</code>, <code>nat</code> and <code>mangle</code> tables
          are required for both <code>IPv4</code> and <code>IPv6</code>.

          When starting a migration libvirt performs some sanity checks
          to make sure domain will be able to run on the destination.
          One of the requirements is that the disk has to either be
          migrated too or be accessible from a network filesystem. CEPH
          and GPFS weren't detected as a network filesystem.

                  <dd>
          Libvirt used to just start QEMU, let it allocate memory for
          the guest, and then use CGroups to move the memory to
          configured NUMA nodes. This is suboptimal as huge chunks of
          memory have to be moved. Moreover, this relies on ability to
          move memory later which is not always true. A change was made
          to set process affinity correctly from the start so that memory
          is allocated on the configured nodes from the beginning.

          By default, libvirt runs the QEMU process as <code>qemu:qemu</code>
          which could cause issues during probing as some features like AMD SEV
          might be inaccessible to QEMU because of file system permissions.
          Therefore, <code>CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE</code> is granted to overcome these
          for the purposes of probing.

          This works with QEMU 4.0.0+ only and is opt-in at the moment, since

          network: Fix virtual networks on systems using firewalld+nftables
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          Because of the transitional state of firewalld's new support
          for nftables, not all iptables features required by libvirt
          are yet available, so libvirt must continue to use iptables
          for its own packet filtering rules even when the firewalld
          backend is set to use nftables. However, due to the way
          iptables support is implemented in kernels using nftables
          (iptables rules are converted to nftables rules and
          processed in a separate hook from the native nftables
          rules), guest networking was broken on hosts with firewalld
          configured to use nftables as the backend. This has been
          fixed by putting libvirt-managed bridges in their own
          firewalld zone, so that guest traffic can be forwarded
          beyond the host and host services can be exposed to guests
          on the virtual network without opening up those same
          services to the rest of the physical network. This means
          that host access from virtual machines is no longer
          controlled by the firewalld default zone (usually "public"),
          but rather by the new firewalld zone called "libvirt"
          (unless configured otherwise using the new zone
          attribute of the network bridge element).

          solution is to use different method to reboot or shutdown the

          specifying it nor by the storage pool translation function.

          In some cases QEMU can get to 100% and still not reach the

          <code>VIR_DOMAIN_BLOCK_JOB_READY</code> event which does not
          suffer from this problem.

          libxl: Handle external domain destroy
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          Historically, if a domain was destroyed using <code>xl</code>
          rather than through libvirt APIs, libvirt would not be aware of
          the fact and keep considering it as running. This is no longer the
          case.

                  <dd>
          If OpenGL support is needed (either with SPICE gl enabled or with
          egl-headless), libvirt is now able to pick the first available DRI
          device for the job. At the same time, this improvement is also a
          bugfix as it prevents permission-related issues with regards to our
          mount namespaces and the default DRI render node's permissions which
          would normally prevent QEMU from accessing such a device.

          Since 4.5.0, libvirt is using FD passing to hand sockets over to

          the user under which the QEMU process is running; however, other
          processes such as vdsm need to access the sockets as well, which
          means adjusting permissions is still necessary.

          Historically libvirt prevented concurrent accesses to

          other querying guest agent) would serialize which hurts
          performance. The code was reworked to allow two
          independent calls run at the same time.

          Recent versions of QEMU activate block devices before the guest CPU
          has been started, which makes it impossible to roll back a failed
          migration. Use the <code>late-block-activate</code> migration
          capability if supported to avoid the issue.

          Xen: Remove hard-coded scheduler weight
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          The libxl driver was accidentally hard-coding the per-domain
          scheduler weight to 1000, silently ignoring any user-provided
          <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code> in <code>&lt;cputune&gt;</code>. The
          driver now honors <code>&lt;shares&gt;</code>, and defers setting
          a default value to Xen. Note that the Xen default is 256, so any
          domains started after this improvement will have one fourth the
          shares of previously started domains. If all domains must have
          equal CPU shares, administrators must manually set the weight of
          previously started domains to 256, or restart them.

          The VirtualBox driver now supports the <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code>
          element in the domain XML for configuring storage controllers in VBOX
          VMs.  Additionally, libvirt's domain XML schema was updated to allow
          optional <code>model</code> attribute for <code>&lt;controller
              type='ide'&gt;</code> which is used by the VBOX driver to set the
          IDE controller model to be one of 'piix4', 'piix4' (default), or
          'ich6'.  Finally, with this change <code>dumpxml</code> generates
          <code>&lt;controller&gt;</code> elements that correspond to current
          VBOX VM storage controller configuration.

          In VirtualBox, SCSI and SAS are distinct controller types whereas

          updated to allow attaching SAS controllers via <code>&lt;controller
              type='scsi' model='lsisas1068'&gt;</code> element. If there are
          both SCSI and SAS controllers present in the VBOX VM, the domain XML
          can associate the disk device using the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code>
          element with the <code>controller</code> attribute, and optionally,
          set the port via <code>unit</code> attribute.

          Shareable disks work properly with recent qemu
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          Recent qemu versions added image locking to avoid potential corruption
          of disk images. This broke shareable disks with libvirt since the
          feature was turned on by default in qemu. Libvirt now enables sharing
          of those disks in qemu so that the image locking is not applied in
          that case. Additionally libvirt now checks that shareable disks have
          supported format (raw) to avoid metadata corruption.

          When a VirtualBox VM has multiple disks attached, each to a different

          one disk attached to SATA and one to SCSI controller, it no longer
          generates XML where both would have 'sda' device name assigned.
          Instead it properly assigns 'sda' and 'sdb' to those disks in the
          order of appearance.

          On a host where numerous unique instances are executed per day, it's
          quite possible that, even though each of the single log files are
          fairly small, collectively the quantity and volume may add tens of
          thousands of log files to the <code>/var/log/libvirt/qemu/</code>
          directory. Removing the constraints that log have to be bigger than
          100 KiB before they can be rotated solves the issue.

          After introducing sparse stream features there were still some known
          bugs left. Those are fixed in this release.

          Libvirt starts qemu domains in separate Linux namespaces for a while
          now. However, there were still some bugs lingering. For instance
          libvirt did not know how to handle file based bind mounts.

          Add an optional boot parameter 'loadparm' for a boot device.
          Loadparm is an 8 byte parameter that, when present, is queried by
          S390 guests via sclp or diag 308. Linux guests on S390 use it to
          select a boot entry.

          Disk images of an external snapshot created with

          The metadata is necessary to allow keeping relative paths between

          Some locales, such as <code>de_DE</code> and <code>pt_BR</code>,
          use comma rather than dot to separate the integer part from the
          fractional part of a decimal number; however, several data sources
          such as the kernel use a locale-independent representation and need
          to be treated accordingly.

          When the guest is started, libvirt updates the CPU definition to
          reflect the actual CPU features to enforce ABI. We need to send
          original and updated CPU definition in order to support migration
          to older libvirt/QEMU versions. Only the updated CPU definition
          was sent to destination.

          they were not saved in the XML. It is now possible to see
          and control the listen addresses properly.

          Even though they were added automatically when USB device
          was attached, they could've been missing in some other
          cases. The logic is now fixed so there are always USB
          controllers, even if there was none of them in the specified
          XML.

          QEMU presents to the guest OS exactly matches the one provided on
          the source host (or before the domain's state was saved). This
          enhanced check may also be requested when starting a new domain to

          API it allows registering thresholds for given storage backing
          volumes and this event will then notify management if the threshold
          is exceeded. Currently only the qemu driver supports this.

          The bhyve driver now supports booting using the UEFI boot ROM,
          so non-FreeBSD guests that support UEFI could be booted without
          using an external boot loader like grub-bhyve. Video is also
          supported now, allowing to connect to guests via VNC and use
          an USB tablet as an input device. Please refer to
          the driver page for domain XML examples.

          QEMU: Use adaptive timeout for connecting to monitor
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          When starting qemu, libvirt waits for qemu to create the monitor
          socket which libvirt connects to. Historically, there was sharp 30
          second timeout after which the qemu process was killed. This
          approach is suboptimal as in some scenarios with huge amounts of
          guest RAM it can take a minute or more for kernel to allocate and
          zero out pages for qemu. The timeout is now flexible and computed by
          libvirt at domain startup.

          fabric_name is one of many fc_host attributes in Linux that is
          optional and left to the low-level driver to decide if it is
          implemented. For example the zfcp device driver does not provide a
          fabric name for an fcp host. The requirement for the existence of
          a fabric name has been removed by making it optional.

          bhyve: change address allocation schema for SATA disks
        </dt>
                  <dd>
          Previously, the bhyve driver assigned PCI addresses to SATA disks
          directly rather than assigning that to a controller and
          using SATA addresses for disks. It was implemented this way
          because bhyve has no notion of an explicit SATA controller.
          However, as this doesn't match libvirt's understanding of
          disk addresses, the bhyve driver was changed to follow
          the common schema and have PCI addresses for SATA controllers
          and SATA addresses for disks. If you're having issues
          because of this, it's recommended to edit the domain's XML
          and remove &lt;address type='pci'&gt; from the &lt;disk&gt;
          elements with &lt;target bus='sata'/&gt; and let libvirt
          regenerate it properly.

                  <dd>
          Those old VirtualBox versions have been unsupported by
          upstream for a long time and the API of 4.0 and newer has
          diverged enough to require code abstractions to handle differences.
          Removing support for those old versions drops lots of code from
          the driver and simplifies the logic to ease implementation of new
          features going forward.

          When pcie-root-ports are added to pcie-root in order to
          provide a place to connect PCI Express endpoint devices,
          libvirt now aggregates multiple root ports together onto the
          same slot (up to 8 per slot) in order to conserve slots.
          Using this method, it's possible to connect more than 200
          endpoint devices to a guest that uses PCIe without requiring
          setup of any PCIe switches.

          The libvirt_lxc process was previously not moved into the

          after a container is started, when libvirtd is later restarted
          it will accidentally kill the containers.

                  <dd>
          The libvirt website looked very cluttered and outdated; it has now
          been completely overhauled, resulting in a design that's better
          organized and more pleasant to look at.
